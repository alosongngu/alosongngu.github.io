A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13.560
Good evening. It's 7:00 p.m. You're listening to France Inter.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16.560
Thank you, Éric Andréï, for joining us this morning.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19.320
What do you think of Stéphane Blé as the next French president?

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21.200
Despite my friendship with Stéphane,

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23.440
no, II can't support him, I really can't.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26.520
But on the other hand, Corinne Douanier, uh, isis a woman,

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28.920
and a woman who is, uh, she is the better choice.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30.280
The better choice.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32.680
Mr. Blé. Mr. Blé. Over here.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34.520
Do you know the location of Lamine Touré?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37.880
You know the man in a coma?  Think you could be elected?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40.400
Listen, I don't know what's going on with this, folks.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42.000
All I'm gonna say is, in a democracy,

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45.120
there's a basic principle dubbed as the presumption of innocence.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48.680
If that applies to all our expresidents, it should apply to Lamine Touré,

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50.600
a young man with a clean record, no problems.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52.600
So you do know him?

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54.600
No.  You just said you did.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57.520
All right, please step back. No more questions. Please, move aside.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00.040
Quit talking about Lamine. It's causing nothing but trouble.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01.040
You don't know him.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02.840
It's a setup by Andréï's team. Your hand.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06.840
Hand in front. Don't touch your mouth. It's a setup by Andréï.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08.520
I don't give a fuck about that. Please!

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15.080
POLICE STATION

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17.640
You can see on the man's face, he's culpable, right?

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20.160
But I don't have anything on the guy, okay?

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22.240
I won't arrest one of the presidential contenders

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23.320
because he's ugly.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25.160
Well, you see…

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26.880
…the laws are written badly.

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29.480
Didn't you say you'd trace the phone, the kid's

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31.640
The request was submitted, but it's dragging.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34.440
Ah, it's dragging. All right.

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35.480
Yeah, dragging.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41.720
Tell me, aren't you waiting on a construction permit

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43.000
for your future house?

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47.200
I believe I'm in charge of the file.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51.040
That's also dragging. I'm sorry, Pierrot.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53.840
I'm not happy with this, but now it's force majeure.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55.840
All right, then. Fine.

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59.000
There.

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02.040
I sent it in. You'll have a response in ten minutes.

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03.800
And the permit is mine.

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06.520
Listen, if you want, I'll knock down the daycare for you.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08.600
You can build a pool and a solarium too.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14.360
Another question, maybe?

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17.600
You.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20.240
What's your take on the prevalence of other European laws

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21.400
over our French laws?

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22.560
Uh…

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25.160
Uh, hold on. Is this the gifted class or what?

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29.520
Yeah, it'sit's just the new generation. Kindergarten was my pick.

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32.920
Marion is trying to reach you. It sounds like it's really urgent.

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38.040
Uh, listen, kids, I just need two minutes.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40.360
What? Why? What's…

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41.720
What's goin' on?

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43.280
Stéphane?

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50.200
Hello? What's the matter?

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51.880
Stéphane, there's tons police.

62
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54.440
Who called them? We got snitched on for sure.

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57.080
We're surrounded. They're behind the house.

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59.400
Oh, fuck! Why did I have to listen to you? You're wrong.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01.600
This is insane. We'll surrender.  Okay.

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03.680
We'll surrender.  Don't move. I'm coming.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06.120
National police! Open up!

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08.360
Lamine, go hide in the bedroom.

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09.600
Go on.

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12.680
Marion just called me.

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15.720
She's really panicking, okay? The cops are there looking for Lamine.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18.360
This is useless, because no one's around. Get it? Put it down.

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21.240
Hold on. What do you mean? Lamine, you know where he is?

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25.480
Is this another one of your hustles? No. No, no, no. It wasn't him.

75
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28.280
I'm the one who sent them both to get Lamine so they could hide out.

76
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31.480
Okay, Stéphane, you know what? Think for a minute, please.

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34.800
We can't go a hundred meters without having 50 cameras on our ass.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39.400
So, Lamine, if he wants to surrender, he can do it in Normandy, in the Poitou.

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41.080
I don't care. Just far away from you.

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43.120
Yes, but far away from me is with Marion.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45.320
It was me who fucked up here. So, it's simple.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48.760
I'll get Lamine, we'll come back here, he surrenders, end of story.

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51.480
All right, find me an event in Normandy. Something, anything.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53.880
Uh, lunch with a former convicts association?

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55.760
That's just fabulous.

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58.440
Super idea for a man who just walked out of the station. Genius.

87
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01.400
Picnic at the mosque in Lisieux. That'd look great, like multicultural.

88
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03.360
Perfect. Perfect.  Oh, fuck.

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05.280
Yeah? That's even better. Amazing.

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06.720
A mosque, huh? Meaning what?

91
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10.160
In terms of unifying symbols, it's not exactly great.

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13.280
There are way more secular things. Please don't look at me like that.

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16.240
Such as? More secular, like what?  Yes. Don't do narrow eyes.

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18.920
Let me tell you, I can do it too.  We'll do it together.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21.560
Hey, let's act like politicians.  Fine. Give me ideas.

96
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23.760
Cheese, for example. Or, like, a thing with oysters.

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25.960
Mmhmm. Mm. See? There. OrOr maybe…

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28.680
Sausages. That speaks to everyone. Ah, obviously. Yes indeed.

99
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31.200
Sausages. Pork is secular.  Are you two done?

100
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33.800
That's true. I got it! A festival for crêpes.

101
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36.360
In CondésurNoireau. I'm on board.

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38.720
I can't keep down crêpes.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50.840
Do you have the key to this door, ma'am?

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53.160
Um, no. This is my friend's place.

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54.840
Hmm.

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57.160
Well, take her down.

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59.920
I swear on my mother, you touch her, shit's about to go down here.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01.680
Yeah, for sure. Shit's about to go down.

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04.120
I just meant the door.

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06.960
Go on.

111
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12.640
Whoa. What's that, huh?

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16.360
Too close to the hinges. Just move. What do they teach in the police academy?

113
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18.400
Flat part of your shoulder, level with the keyhole,

114
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19.960
and then, sharp blow like this.

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29.160
No, um…

116
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31.360
No, man, just do it like, um, like you normally do.

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34.920
Like normal, yeah. Go on.

118
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54.280
Marion, it's me.

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56.000
Well?

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58.760
Everything's a mess. Lamine took off.

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01.560
He freaked out, left his cell phone. I'm pinned with all the cameras.

122
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03.760
He's all out there alone, and it's our fault,

123
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05.480
because we didn't do what was needed.

124
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07.280
I'm just gutted. No, it's my fault.

125
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09.960
I'll handle it, I promise. Don't worry. Stop. I can't with you.

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13.040
Let's just We need her to come. Shit. Aren't you sick of making promises?

127
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15.080
It's endless. You promised not to campaign.

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17.040
You promised you wouldn't ruin our lives

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20.000
We were supposed to arrive 30 minutes ago at the festival of crêpes.

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23.920
What's this now? A festival for crêpes? I just needed an excuse to come out here.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26.320
It's nothing. Right. The campaign continues.

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29.120
Obviously, it's only me that cares. Nobody else seems to.

133
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32.320
Well, except for Lamine, because he'll be needing a pardon.

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33.560
You can eat crêpes now?

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35.480
No, man, I can't.

136
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37.680
I can't eat them. I'll get the runs.

137
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38.840
Oh.

138
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41.280
Maybe it's because of the lactose, or something like that.

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43.680
Yeah, yeah, it's the lactose. I'm the same way, uh…

140
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46.080
Stopped eating dairy entirely, yeah.

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48.160
Oh, yeah? Yeah, now I've switched to soy

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50.560
No, hang on. You guys are… Lamine!

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51.720
Lamine!

144
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54.040
He must be at the train station. Where are you going?

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55.640
What? Please, don't act like that.

146
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57.800
We'll go to the crêpe festival, and while we're there,

147
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00.040
William and Mo will go to the train station to look.

148
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02.160
They'll come back together, and when we're all there,

149
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03.400
I'll take him to the police

150
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04.960
No, but Nonnegotiable.

151
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05.880
Okay.

152
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09.680
Here you go.

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12.160
Thank you, sir.

154
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15.760
Great dry cider this morning. Everything has to be gone by tonight.

155
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17.640
All right then. Let's begin. Anyone? Anyone?

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19.480
Thank you. Please, enjoy.

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21.680
Richard, we need some batter. It's good.

158
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25.120
Oh, well, it's homemade. Yeah, it's all homemade.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28.120
It's great!

160
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29.640
And, tell me, Madam Mayor,

161
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31.560
the name of the village, CondésurNoireau,

162
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33.240
is it in any way connected to Condé Nast?

163
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34.280
No, no, not at all.

164
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36.840
No, it'sit's two rivers, the Druance and the Noireau.

165
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38.680
They really named the village. I see.

166
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40.480
Tell me, do you like crêpes savory or sweet?

167
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41.720
Honestly, neither of them.

168
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44.040
No, I love both kinds equally.

169
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44.960
Ah. Yes.

170
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48.040
Well, you won't have to choose. We're gonna try them all.

171
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50.720
Get me a Camembert and sausage for Mr. Blé.

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52.160
You'll start with that one.

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56.040
The grease completely coats the stomach. Then you can eat all the food you want.

174
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57.280
Trust me on this.

175
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03.360
Could I just get one with sugar? No?

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04.920
Oh, no. Such a shame. Try it.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07.520
For you, sir. This one's a specialty of our village.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08.960
You'll see. It's delicious.

179
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11.840
Go.

180
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16.200
Oh, shit, that smells.

181
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19.280
Well, yes, our Camembert smells great. That's normal.

182
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20.600
It looks great, yeah.

183
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22.760
I can adapt, just like the French.

184
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27.440
Ah…  Mm!

185
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29.960
I can tell he's loving it. Yes, isn't he?

186
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31.720
Well, isn't that nice?

187
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33.640
I can tell he's enjoying it.

188
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35.640
The taste buds just… buh, buh, buh.

189
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39.240
This is just excellent.  Of course. He's happy.

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40.160
I think so.

191
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50.080
Lamine.

192
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55.040
Listen, he peaced out. Let's get out of here. Come on.

193
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58.800
Lamine! Oh, what the fuck?

194
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00.320
Quit yelling like that.

195
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02.360
Let's go. It's useless. Quit looking.

196
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07.480
Hey, hey, hey. William.  Oh, Lamine.

197
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10.040
You okay? Yeah.

198
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12.160
Come back. Stéphane will go to the cops with you

199
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14.920
No, no, no. If he does that, he'll never get elected, man. No way.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18.600
He asked us to take you back. We'll  Ah, shit. The cops are here.

201
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21.200
Yeah, yeah. Relax, relax. Just give me some money, some cash.

202
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24.080
We're just talking like normal. Relax. We're talking. Smile, smile.

203
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26.040
I'll give you 20 euro.  Okay.

204
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28.400
Give me the change and a receipt back, all right? Please.

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30.840
Okay, listen, hey. He said to take you back, let's go back.

206
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32.560
No. We can't do that. We can't do that!

207
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37.040
Gentlemen. Hello, gentlemen.  Quit it now.

208
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38.520
Hello.  You all right?

209
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39.560
We're fine.

210
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41.560
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

211
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43.960
But you specifically asked me if I was all right.

212
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46.320
Yes. And why not those two?

213
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49.800
Wow! I hope this isn't what I think it is.

214
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52.200
No, because I can see you're being kind to me,

215
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53.680
it's all fine, sir, because you are.

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56.200
But me being lightcomplected, and these two are…

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58.120
No, this is insane. I think this is…

218
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00.600
Excuse me, but I'm disgusted, revolted.  No, no, no.

219
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01.800
Drop it.  No!

220
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03.200
There are several shades of black.

221
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04.760
There are 50 shades.  Sir… Sir…

222
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07.200
You filthy racist! No, no. Calm down, please, sir.

223
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09.760
I'm perfectly calm. I didn't perceive these two as Black.

224
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13.120
Wow! Oh, that'sthat's… that's an argument I don't believe.

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15.720
You can't tell he's Black? He's the blackest guy in France.

226
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18.600
William… Who are you kidding? You filthy racist!

227
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21.240
Excuse me? No, wait. Racist! You're disgusting. I'm disgusted.

228
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23.040
My brother's wife's from the Congo.

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24.040
Ah, all right.

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26.120
What's the preferred meal of the Congolese?

231
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27.680
It's pondu.

232
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29.600
Oh, he got you. He's right.

233
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31.440
I'm right or what? It's pondu. Yeah, pondu!

234
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33.400
He's right. Good day, gentlemen.

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35.320
Have a good day. They have it with beans or…

236
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37.240
With beans. Yeah, they do. Yeah!

237
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43.720
I don't think it's a great idea.

238
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45.000
We're bringing you with us.

239
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47.320
Hey, hey. Calm down, Mo. Hey, man. First of all…

240
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49.200
First of all, it's not Mo. It's Maurice.

241
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51.920
I'm not your pal. Let's go.  Mo, he's gonna lose.

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55.040
Hey, we'd be great friends, Mo. Mo. MoMo. Mo!

243
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57.520
But, yes, we nailed it!  He's happy?

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59.120
Yes, he's had

245
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00.520
All right.

246
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03.920
That was JeanLuc on the phone. The boy's still missing.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06.200
Well, I'm sure they didn't find the kid.

248
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09.160
I know he's hiding the little bastard. He's trying to help him escape.

249
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11.640
Here's what you do. You'll block all access to the city.

250
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13.360
You'll put a cop on every street corner.

251
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15.080
Do you hear that? What?

252
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17.840
We're in the middle of eight trials with the leaks.

253
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19.880
Getting through this will be a miracle. You…

254
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22.840
Jérôme, now, if your balls aren't big enough to do what I say,

255
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25.280
I'll cross the street and I'll find another aide

256
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26.600
with some seriously huge balls.

257
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28.000
Okay? Now go!

258
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30.840
I'll be across the street with a client who's mind isn't going.

259
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34.920
You start a war when you want to, you end it when you're able to.

260
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40.160
Machiavelli? Mitterrand.

261
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41.120
Hmm.

262
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43.360
We will get Blé.

263
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44.880
Hmm. I promise you.

264
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46.600
But not today, Éric.

265
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48.200
All right.

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07.880
Don't talk till your lawyer arrives, okay? I'll get you one right away.

267
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10.000
It's fine. Don't worry.

268
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16.240
You did nothing wrong.

269
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24.000
All right, then. Let's go. No, I'll go alone.

270
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26.280
You head to HQ. No way. Come on, let's go.

271
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28.080
Think, Stéph. What difference will it make?

272
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31.680
I mean, I'm not sure. I'll explain that No, you're not gonna explain all this.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34.040
If you wanna help me, then win this election, that's all.

274
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38.040
Imagine Marion and you in the Élysée. It would be dope.

275
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45.840
Stéphane…  Hmm?

276
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48.080
Save me a kitchen job in the Élysée when I get out.

277
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49.400
Promise. Promise.

278
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51.440
Thank you, Marion.

279
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11.160
I'll head to HQ. See you at home later?

280
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13.480
No.

281
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16.320
I won't be home later.

282
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19.440
He trusted you, he wanted to help you,

283
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22.360
and you left him in a pile of shit for an election.

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28.360
YouYou aren't capable of handling a young man who's just been misguided

285
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30.200
and you wanna manage the people of France?

286
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33.240
No, but, hang on. I truly No, there's no "hang on," Stéphane.

287
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37.080
I don't recognize you. I don't know you. You've changed.

288
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41.840
You said you wouldn't, but you have changed.

289
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48.720
Look, I fell in love with a local monitor…

290
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50.560
not this politician.

291
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02.520
Hey, some politicians are great people, you know.

292
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04.560
You need to stop stigmatizing everyone.

293
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14.480
MAKING MEALS FOR A STEAL

294
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22.040
POLICE STATION

295
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24.440
Thirty minutes ago, Lamine Touré turned himself in

296
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25.400
to the police.

297
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28.960
I hope he'll be allowed to tell his version of the facts,

298
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32.600
that he will be heard, and that he'll be treated well.

299
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37.360
The reason he was afraid to surrender

300
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40.320
is that he no longer trusts us adults, any of us.

301
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44.360
We made too many promises and kept too few, me most of all.

302
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48.000
I promised him my help and protection,

303
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50.600
and I let him down.

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52.800
We all let him down.

305
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57.880
Lamine Touré surrendered because he's a good kid.

306
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01.000
I hope that justice will do its duty

307
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04.320
and it'll prove that he was right to trust in it.

308
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07.280
Do you think you still have a chance at election, Mr. Blé?

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10.600
I'm not that sure right now.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13.600
I had a few things to say,

311
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15.560
and I just hope that they were heard.

312
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18.040
What I can tell the French people…

313
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21.480
is to vote for Blé or Douanier…

314
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24.120
but vote.

315
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25.600
But still, uh, vote Blé.

316
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27.440
He'll win it.

317
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29.360
There. More questions?

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34.000
FRANCE FOR ALL MAKING MEALS FOR A STEAL

319
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45.520
Marion, are you there?

320
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38.400
You haven't even dressed. Why?

321
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40.080
You need to vote now.

322
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41.680
All right, come on. Get ready.

323
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45.320
Mom, it's useless.

324
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49.040
It's all over, Mom. I'm gonna lose.

325
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55.040
I was born in 1956 in Nayou, Republic of the Ivory Coast.

326
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58.040
At the time, the Ivory Coast was still French.

327
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00.800
So, I was always French, my son.

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03.400
Yes, French. I always told you that.

329
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07.040
When I came to live in Paris in 1977,

330
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08.680
I thought it was logical.

331
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12.080
It was a bit like Breton going to the capital.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15.680
And a few years later, you were born here.

333
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18.280
You were also born French.

334
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20.400
Whether you're the president or not,

335
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21.720
you've won already.

336
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24.000
You trusted yourself.

337
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25.920
You spoke loud and clear.

338
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28.600
Everywhere in France, people listened to you.

339
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31.200
You changed things for us.

340
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34.400
That is a success.

341
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36.880
I am proud of you, my son.

342
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39.880
Thank you, Mom.

343
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43.520
Where's Marion? Has she left to vote?

344
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46.640
She split.

345
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47.760
Left me, yeah.

346
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51.720
Let me admit something to you both.

347
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54.120
I never really approved of that one.

348
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57.920
Anyway, they're all bad, the Malians. She's Senegalese.

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01.000
Well, it's the same, you know. They're all bad news. They are.

350
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04.200
And when they get pregnant, you see their true colors.

351
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06.280
She's not pregnant.

352
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09.000
We never did the IVF.

353
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12.400
I always mess things up, Mom.

354
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16.880
Hmm. Have faith in the Eternal.

355
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19.920
Trust that His grandeur will manifest in the ballots today.

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22.120
Amen! Amen!

357
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24.640
I'm convinced you invent these day after day, don't you?

358
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26.920
Gifts from Heaven.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28.240
I'm just the messenger.

360
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31.120
Let's go. Let's go, my son.

361
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40.400
Today, 46 million French people were called to vote at the ballot boxes.

362
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42.320
And tonight, one thing is for sure.

363
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46.720
France will have chosen a president unlike any the country has ever known.

364
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12.320
ANYTHING BUT A FREEMASON

365
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34.000
Well, yeah…

366
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34.960
All the same.

367
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40.320
Did you see? Fiftyone against 49 in Belgium for Corinne.

368
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44.120
Same in Sweden. Fiftyeight against 42. It's even worse.

369
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46.400
Oh, Yas, can you please write an address for Stéphane?

370
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48.880
Something clean like, "I respect the French people's choice.

371
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49.960
Well done, Corinne."

372
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01.320
I've been watching the news, so don't bother explaining.

373
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02.360
I already saw.

374
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04.760
The leaks, that was me.

375
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06.960
What? Yeah.

376
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10.120
With my collective, we hacked all their emails and spread 'em.

377
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12.680
You did that for me? I didn't do it for you.

378
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14.640
We worked on the project for a year,

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16.840
to bust up the elections, and that's what we did.

380
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18.520
And I discovered this.

381
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29.200
Your socalled "reliable guy"…

382
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32.080
well, he fooled us all.

383
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38.560
Hey, Stéphane.

384
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41.440
Is there an issue, apart from defeat?

385
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44.040
You didn't believe in this. What's that?

386
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47.160
Don't take me for a moron. You worked against me since the beginning.

387
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50.160
I… Wow.

388
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53.200
So I was expecting anything else. Are you crazy or what?

389
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57.320
Are you serious right now? No, that's crazy.

390
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00.360
Hey, you need to ignore the media, the buzz, all that bull.

391
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02.640
It's likely that Russian leak. They've been after us

392
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04.680
Please, respect me this one time. Fuck!

393
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09.880
You used me.

394
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14.920
Okay, II didn't believe in it,

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18.080
but just at the beginning.

396
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21.080
After that, I really did. But I needed to get back in the game.

397
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24.000
I needed to find a port of entry. It was amazing!

398
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25.680
We'll make it now. I can just feel it.

399
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29.520
We'veWe've accumulated enough experience to go all the way in five years.

400
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31.640
We have a project, that I promise.

401
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33.560
You're a fucking liar. Just get out.

402
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35.680
Stéphane…

403
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37.160
Get out!

404
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38.280
Stéphane, look…

405
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40.080
All right, Stéphane.

406
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42.520
Stéphane, please, don't do this.

407
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46.840
You… Not cool.

408
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48.680
Not cool. Not cool at all.

409
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50.720
There are a few minutes remaining in which to vote,

410
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53.640
and we are not allowed to relay any rumors,

411
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56.280
but after having stopped in on the campaign HQs,

412
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58.640
we have a clear idea of the final results.

413
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59.760
Yes! Oh, yes!

414
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02.320
At Corinne Douanier's HQ, victory appears certain.

415
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08.760
Oh, yes! Against all odds!  Thank you, thank you.

416
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11.320
A stark change at Stéphane Blé's HQ.

417
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16.160
Hey, cut the sound. Cut the sound, please.

418
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25.680
Well, it's a loss. It's what we knew.

419
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28.560
But I still wanted to thank each of you.

420
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31.600
Because we ran a campaign that rocked and fought.

421
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34.680
We talked about topics that no one else would.

422
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37.720
So I wanted, first of all, to say thank you to everyone.

423
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45.800
I'd even like to further specify

424
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49.200
that the reason we lost is strictly because of me.

425
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50.720
And, uh…

426
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52.840
I hope that we created a movement…

427
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56.640
I hope that we…

428
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00.960
…that we got folks, uh, interested in politics.

429
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03.280
Hey, are you two serious?

430
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05.000
Go on, go on. You say it.

431
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08.760
See, your father and I have decided to give things a second chance.

432
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12.080
Hey. Whoa. Why are you cheering?

433
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13.560
Whoa, whoa.

434
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15.400
It's the pheromones.

435
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21.000
Can't control it, my son.  Yeah, you said it, uncle!

436
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23.200
It is now 7:59 p.m.

437
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26.480
Five, four, three,

438
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28.720
two, one.

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32.240
There. It's eight o'clock.

440
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33.440
And it's…

441
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37.000
Stéphane Blé who won the election…

442
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39.280
…with 51.8 percent of votes

443
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42.920
against 48.2 percent for Corinne Douanier.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45.080
This is much more than a surprise.

445
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48.160
This is very much a political earthquake. It's another man.

446
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51.360
Hey, Corinne, don't assume they're a man. No, no. I'm sorry.

447
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54.840
I repeat, Stéphane Blé is now the president of France…

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58.360
…with 51.8 percent of the votes.

449
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01.240
Sweet Jesus! Thank you, Lord!  The sound, turn it on!

450
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03.320
It would appear that the French people lied

451
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06.160
at the exit polls, and that inside the voting booths,

452
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10.360
they prefer to vote for a man who's incompetent rather than a woman.

453
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13.360
It's… disappointing.

454
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17.240
You're president, my guy!

455
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19.320
We did it! We did it, Stéphane!

456
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22.080
Yeah!

457
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25.000
We won! We won!

458
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30.280
ELECTIONS  UNEXPECTED VICTORY BY CANDIDATE STÉPHANE BLÉ.

459
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31.720
HIS HQ IS CELEBRATING.

460
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36.680
Oh, yes! That's my boy! That's my son!

461
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39.080
Yeah! Yeah!

462
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42.240
["Aux armes et caetera" by Serge Gainsbourg playing]

463
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52.800
FRANCE FOR ALL

464
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57.440
The French have chosen me as their president.

465
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59.560
Amen!

466
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02.840
All right, just the ones who were registered to vote, in reality.

467
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04.760
Wait. You're right.

468
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07.400
Just the ones who voted. "The French" is too much.

469
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10.760
But it's still many people who voted.

470
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12.920
I'll act as president for all the French.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14.640
No one will be overlooked,

472
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17.960
not in the cities or in the commonwealth or the suburbs.

473
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21.680
I'll act as president for Blacks for whites, for Chinese…

474
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24.160
Sorry. Asians.

475
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26.720
Don't start screwing up from the getgo, Stéphane!

476
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28.840
I'll act as president for Bobos,

477
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30.080
for thugs,

478
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32.080
for all women, in hijabs or not,

479
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33.280
redheads, dwarfs…

480
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35.520
Now I've seen it all. A Black president.

481
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38.120
You'd have preferred the chick? Stéphane?

482
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39.680
Stéphane?

483
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45.840
I'll be a free president, a president who never gives up.

484
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48.120
And I will implement my key measure,

485
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50.280
"Making meals… for a steal."

486
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52.840
Amen, my son!  Long live France.

487
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54.480
Long live the Republic.

488
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55.960
With a few caveats, though.

489
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58.600
Salaam. Shalom. See you.

490
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01.360
And also, as the Hindus say…

491
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03.800
Hmm. I don't know what the Hindus say.

492
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04.920
But I'm with them.

493
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08.320
All together, one team.

494
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10.800
Right. Right.
