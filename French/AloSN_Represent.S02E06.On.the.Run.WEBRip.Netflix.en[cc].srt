1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15.880
While President Blé and his social policies

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18.440
seem to be rejected by the majority of French people,

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21.600
a mob of Frédéric Cognard's supporters have stormed the Élysée

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24.560
after Cognard turned down the Prime Minister position.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28.080
They're endangering our institutions and democracy as we speak.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31.480
We still haven't heard from President Blé, who must be feeling threatened.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32.400
FRANCE SHAKEN

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34.520
Over here, Mr. President.  Yeah.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36.280
It's here.  Where is it?

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39.080
It's not here, this one. Oh yeah, that's the one.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40.000
Come on, Alice.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41.960
You don't know where the bunker is? Yeah, I do.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46.120
Yeah!

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48.920
This place is too spotless. Get this place clean.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50.960
Let's stand together. This is our home!

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53.360
We have rightful ownership of all these things.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56.200
It's here! Found it. Go ahead, I'll take care of it.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58.040
Ah!  Let's capture them!

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01.320
We'll keep up with the events throughout the night so you can experience it live

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02.760
and see these tragic events unfold.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03.960
PRESIDENT NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06.920
Where's Blé? Where is he?  Mess up this furniture!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08.040
You bastard!

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10.120
We're going to look for him!

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11.360
Yeah!

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13.640
Let's invite him to our home!

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18.160
REPRESENT

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21.840
They're out of control. Let's sequester ourselves.

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24.360
Okay. Very good. We're safe here.  Yeah.

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26.320
It's okay. It's completely isolated.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28.960
What do you mean, "isolated"? I get a bit claustrophobic…

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32.000
Don't worry, William, there's no problem. I have the situation under control.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35.080
I'm gonna contact the outside right away, so they can extract us soon.

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38.120
It has to happen fast. I can't breathe. Damn it, there's no signal.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40.600
Try the landline. No signal? What do you mean, no signal?

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41.880
It means there's no…

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44.640
If the signal doesn't get in, the oxygen doesn't get in.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47.360
I'm panicking. We're gonna die. We're gonna die!

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48.920
Calm down.  We're gonna die!

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51.200
Are you okay? Thanks.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53.040
Yeah, I just can't believe what's happening.

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54.880
Yeah. But it's gonna be fine, don't worry.

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56.720
We're going to die! I can't breathe!

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57.960
What can I do to help?

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59.720
Is it true, what you said earlier?

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00.880
That you love me?

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04.200
Stéphane, now isn't the time. Um, well, yes, it is.

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05.880
If we're gonna die, I'd like to know.

49
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07.440
You've just said it's gonna be fine.

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10.160
Yeah, it's gonna to be fine.

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12.200
But did you mean it or not?  I'm hungry.

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14.040
What's that got to do with anything?

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15.600
Mmhmm.  Fucking hell, Mo.

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18.200
We have to breathe before we eat.  Get him under control.

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20.560
Okay, okay, listen up! Guys, please!

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22.000
You have to calm down.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23.560
We're all safe here.

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26.680
What matters most right now is that we're all together.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28.880
We're gonna die, Stéphane! Whoa!

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30.680
Mr. President?

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38.880
Perhaps we could have a talk?

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41.760
Mama!

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43.200
PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46.080
Protesters have stormed the Élysée.

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49.200
The president is in danger. Let's take action.

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50.120
No.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51.880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57.600
Forgive me, General, but I fear this isn't a good idea.

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01.200
We… We can't fire on demonstrators who are nonviolent and…

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03.360
And innocent.

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06.360
Peaceful and innocent? Come on, please, Mr. Andréï.

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07.760
Yes, General, yes.

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11.200
We… We are human.

74
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14.840
It's not up to us to make these types of decisions.

75
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16.320
However,

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20.200
our president did give the order,

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21.600
he did,

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24.040
to fire at the crowd.

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27.720
He didn't give us the order to fire at the crowd.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37.360
I hear you, Andréï.

81
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39.920
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43.560
Yes, I see. Excuse me, General.

83
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46.040
What's going on?

84
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47.280
What are you doing?

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50.880
I'm not against low blows, but clean low blows.

86
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51.840
This one's nasty.

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54.600
Mm. Do you have a credit card on you?

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55.520
Yes.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58.320
Well, then, it's about time you go buy yourself a pair of balls.

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59.600
You understand me?

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02.400
When you start something,

92
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04.840
you have to finish it.

93
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07.080
Hmm?

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09.400
You don't go to the ball

95
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12.080
unless you want to dance, right?

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16.000
So do you want to dance? Or are you out?

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18.560
Excuse me.

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21.560
It's Alice.

99
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23.360
Hello?  Everything is fine.

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26.040
The president is safe in the bunker. Oh, my Lord!

101
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27.520
Everything's under control.

102
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30.080
The president's safe.  Hello? Hello?

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31.200
Andréï?  Sorry.

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33.840
I was with General Puch and Jérôme.  Oh yeah? Okay.

105
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36.240
Is he with you right now? Yes, he's next to me, I believe.

106
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38.920
I'm sure he is. Can I talk to him, Alice, please?

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41.440
Hello? Andréï? Stéphane.

108
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43.760
Man, oh man, how are you?

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46.760
Listen, you find a way to get us out of here right away.

110
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48.560
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

111
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51.400
Every one of our teams have been mobilized.

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54.040
Don't worry, in an hour, it'll all be resolved. Believe me.

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56.480
You hear me? Yeah, Andréï. You'd better. Seriously.

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58.640
The republic won't give way…

115
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00.840
…to savagery.

116
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04.440
Well, I can tell you that the president is fine.

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10.600
Hand in hand, Mr. Andréï.

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15.440
Oh damn, I've got a cramp right here.

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17.640
I can't breathe in here.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19.240
There's no oxygen.

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21.560
It's totally… It's gotta be airtight.

122
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24.000
How much water do we have left? Two bottles.

123
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25.560
What? Two bottles?  Two bottles.

124
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26.640
We have two bottles left?

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28.440
That's enough.  I can't calm down.

126
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31.640
One bottle for me, that's for sure. My skin gives me a lot of trouble.

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34.120
It starts with blisters, so I have to drink a lot of water.

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36.880
We might end up having to drink our own urine.

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39.160
I saw that in a documentary. Guys who crashed in Colombia.

130
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40.560
They started eating each other

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44.200
That bitch! She's completely crazy!

132
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46.600
Look, don't you touch me! Calm down, William.

133
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48.720
Go over there. Over there! You don't touch me!

134
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51.280
You're crazy! So, what do we do now?

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53.200
Why are you staring at me?

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56.200
Maybe those guys have calmed down.  Let's check right now.

137
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59.640
We still don't know where the president is,

138
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02.280
and the police are having a hard time bringing back order.

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04.960
One thing is certain, nobody can predict the outcome of this crisis.

140
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06.800
No worries. I'm alive and well.

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07.960
That's Didier!

142
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10.760
I had this feeling like we'd forgotten something, you know?

143
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14.440
That was Nesrine Slaoui live from the Élysée,

144
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17.560
waiting to know more on President Blé's current situation.

145
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20.480
Our teams have been mobilized to cover these riots,

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23.160
and you've guessed it, the epicenter of the insurrection

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25.120
happens to be located right next to the Élysée.

148
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26.080
Lord, Jesus.

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28.080
If you save my son,

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30.720
I swear he'll attend Mass on a weekly basis.

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31.720
Amen.

152
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32.760
Amen.

153
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34.120
Don't worry too much.

154
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38.000
Your son can withstand anything. Like a rat in a sewer.

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40.440
…culminated in the assault on the Élysée.

156
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43.600
And now, we bring you the latest update that has just come in.

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46.920
The prime minister will speak soon. Reporting live from Matignon.

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49.920
My dear fellow citizens.

159
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53.800
It is with a heavy heart that I come before you this evening.

160
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55.320
STATEMENT FROM PRIME MINISTER

161
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58.240
The news coming from the Élysée is concerning.

162
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03.880
Our military forces have been mobilized.

163
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06.560
That's why I'll let the Chief of Staff talk.

164
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08.680
General Puch.

165
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14.840
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19.560
Today, at 10:36 p.m.,

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24.040
President Blé gave me the order to open fire on the peaceful protesters…

168
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26.440
What? …at and near the Élysée.

169
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29.400
Did you tell him that? I never said that.

170
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31.920
This order was obviously unconstitutional

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34.240
and against all rules of military engagement.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39.200
I have thus informed the president of my refusal to carry out his order.

173
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44.800
I have sworn to defend my country, not kill my fellow citizens.

174
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47.680
The bastard. Prime Minister.

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49.560
The fucking bastard.

176
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50.920
What the…

177
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52.520
Damn, bro. Fuck.

178
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54.360
Bearing this new information in mind,

179
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57.640
and in accordance to all the institutions of the Republic,

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02.600
we've decided to take action and begin the impeachment process

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04.120
against President Stéphane Blé…

182
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05.480
What? …for high treason.

183
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07.880
Stéphane,

184
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12.000
it's no longer the prime minister talking to you. It's your friend.

185
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13.440
What a bastard.

186
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15.080
Let us stop this madness.

187
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16.240
IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT

188
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18.920
Turn yourself in without any resistance.

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22.560
Let's give back to France its serenity…

190
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26.800
…so that it can progress as before.

191
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30.800
Long live the Republic.

192
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32.720
Long live France.

193
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41.520
Holy shit.

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44.760
A masterpiece. Beautifully done.

195
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47.920
It's a masterpiece of a coup. What a delicate, beautiful job.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49.360
It's clean, neat, no blunders.

197
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50.840
So does it mean… We're fucked.

198
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52.440
High treason for us too?

199
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55.240
Fuck.  'Cause I didn't do anything wrong.

200
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57.840
Hold on. Come on. What we need to do is alert the media.

201
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00.920
We, we have to tell them the truth.  Oh? Hey, wake up.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03.400
Andréï has a firm grip on the narrative.

203
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05.120
We're screwed, all right?

204
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06.320
It's over.

205
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08.200
Rats deserting a sinking ship.

206
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09.760
No, let me explain.

207
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12.840
There's no ship anymore. Actually, there never was one.

208
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15.720
Or if we were on a ship, it went down, and it's over.

209
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18.840
I'm not the kind of guy who's willing to fight arms in hand.

210
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20.920
Sorry. We don't even have weapons.

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23.720
Yeah, yeah, even though I asked for some, right?

212
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25.360
Come on. Shall we go now?

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27.800
Turn yourself in, Mr. President.

214
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29.640
Come out and you won't be harmed.

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31.880
Did he tell us to come out?

216
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33.800
Hmm… I just heard "Mr. President."

217
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37.040
He's got a stutter.  Who's first? Yeah, go ahead.

218
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38.600
You go. No, hold on.

219
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40.480
Wait, wait up. What's…

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44.360
I'm not going. Go ahead and call me. Call me when…

221
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45.760
All right, I'm coming. Okay.

222
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51.640
Mr. President, I… I'm sorry, if you don't come out now,

223
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53.720
we'll have to blow up the doors with explosives.

224
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56.000
If I turn myself in, how do I know you won't kill me?

225
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58.600
We're the French army, Mr. President. We're fucked…

226
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00.760
We're dead. They're gonna kill us.

227
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04.000
We're dead. We're not dead at all.

228
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05.600
On the contrary… I'm scared right now.

229
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07.480
…it's the French Army, so I believe we're fine.

230
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09.120
That's my opinion. It's okay.

231
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10.160
Mr. President!

232
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12.640
If I turn myself in, I want my family spared.

233
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14.920
Granted. And my team, also.

234
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17.360
Thank you.  Granted. You can trust us.

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18.640
I don't have a choice.

236
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21.680
I'll turn myself in on three. Why three?

237
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23.680
I was going to ask the same question.

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25.560
Mr. President… It's all good.

239
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26.920
I'm the one they want.

240
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30.440
No, hold on, hold on. Oh man.

241
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31.760
Oh, God…

242
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33.720
One.

243
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37.320
Two.

244
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46.120
You know, it's… It's not that I don't trust you, Eric.

245
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49.680
But apart from General Puch and yourself,

246
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53.840
nobody's heard the president mutter something about firing at the crowd.

247
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56.480
Tell me, Thierry.

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57.480
You want some? No.

249
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59.000
Sure? No, thanks.

250
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02.520
At the time you submitted your candidacy for Senate president…

251
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03.880
Mmhmm?

252
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07.520
…I think that I called a few people to support you, didn't I?

253
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10.400
Yes, you did. That was very nice of you.

254
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11.440
Mm.

255
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16.720
And who got you out of nasty trouble when you hired your wife as an assistant

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18.120
in the administration?

257
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19.320
I think it was…

258
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20.400
Is it Japanese?

259
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22.600
What's Japanese?

260
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24.080
Your whiskey. I don't know.

261
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26.040
Oh.  So?

262
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30.680
No, hold on. It wasn't like that. She did real work. She prepared my notes.

263
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32.480
I believe you. Okay.

264
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34.560
I believe you because I trust you.

265
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36.000
Hmm. And in return,

266
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37.760
I would like for you to trust me too.

267
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42.520
As president of the Senate, only you can impeach him.

268
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45.880
That man is definitely guilty of high treason.

269
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46.840
Hmm.

270
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48.960
Do you understand?

271
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50.000
Mm…

272
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52.360
So, Thierry. Can I trust you or not?

273
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56.760
Can I trust you?

274
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00.720
You can, Prime Minister.

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01.760
Hmm.

276
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03.800
Sorry.

277
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05.560
Are you doing okay?

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08.280
They're negotiating. We think Stéphane will soon come out alive.

279
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09.320
Thanks for the update.

280
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11.960
Okay, tell Puch to go all out now.

281
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14.560
No, we can't just blow up the Élysée's bunker.

282
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17.200
I can't believe it. Must I do everything by myself?

283
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18.120
Fuck!

284
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21.280
Hey, uh, wait for me.

285
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23.200
All right.

286
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26.400
Come out and you will not be harmed.

287
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28.360
So, guys, what's happening?

288
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30.320
Can you tell me what you're waiting for?

289
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32.600
It's okay, he's about to come out.

290
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34.440
"It's okay, he's about to come out."

291
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36.400
Have you been sucking on a comb, soldier?

292
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39.720
Can't you see he's just buying some time? So blow this door up right now.

293
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41.200
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.

294
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53.480
Go, go, go, go!

295
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04.160
Why?

296
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06.400
Why did you do that?

297
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08.280
Lamine, are you insane?

298
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09.960
Finally, I can help you out of a jam.

299
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12.080
Take these stairs, we'll end up on the street.

300
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13.800
Are you crazy? You can't be seen with us.

301
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15.600
You just can't, you understand? You sure?

302
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18.320
Come on, go. We can handle it, we're good.

303
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19.840
Just go now.

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20.840
Here.

305
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23.520
Wait for them, wait for them.

306
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25.520
What are you doing? Move!

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28.240
I'm stuck at the shoulders.  Suck your stomach in!

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30.120
Get on your side.  Oh, man!

309
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31.920
Your ass is right in my face, dude!

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33.920
I'm mixed CongoleseIvorian, that's why.

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35.720
The ass has me stranded down there as well.

312
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38.360
Squeeze your butt. Give me your arm.  That's repulsive!

313
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40.440
I can see your ass.  Give me your hand.

314
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42.200
Stéphane, we've got to get out of here.

315
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44.600
Mr. President, focus.

316
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56.480
Ooh!

317
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00.960
Where is he? Wow. Impressive.

318
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02.760
Where is he? Pardon?

319
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04.120
The president. Where is he?

320
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07.600
Yeah, I got that. He's, uh… He's here. I'll find him right away. Hold on.

321
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10.440
Stéphane? Hey.

322
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12.160
Hello? Mr. President.

323
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13.080
Oh, he's gone.

324
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15.320
He left. He, uh, might be in London.

325
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17.240
I know you so well I could be your dad.

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18.240
Mmhmm.

327
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20.560
You're not a hero.

328
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24.200
You're a coward. A little piece of shit.

329
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25.160
Oh…

330
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27.440
But I know you're not stupid.

331
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29.240
Hmm. So what is it that you want?

332
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31.600
You want to be the Secretary of the Interior?

333
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33.120
The Prime Minister?

334
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35.880
Tell me where he is, and I'll give you what you want.

335
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36.920
Oh yeah?

336
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39.520
I don't want anything, actually.

337
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42.320
I don't want anything, because I agree with you.

338
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43.720
Stéphane is a guy…

339
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45.280
I mean, he's not dumb.

340
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46.840
He is. No, he's a dreamer.

341
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49.040
No, he's a moron. No, not at all.

342
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50.400
He embodies something real.

343
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51.520
What?

344
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52.600
A sense of hope.

345
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55.080
Yeah? That makes you laugh, huh?

346
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56.000
Yeah.

347
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57.640
Because you don't know what hope is.

348
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59.920
I spent an entire life believing in nothing.

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03.120
And suddenly, I believe in something. In someone, to be accurate.

350
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04.120
You know? Yes.

351
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07.760
And now, every night, I feel real good about going to bed

352
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09.120
with a clear conscience.

353
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10.080
And that's awesome.

354
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11.600
It's really awesome.

355
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14.320
You should try, I'm telling you. I can imagine. I can imagine.

356
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17.760
In any case, I can tell you where you're going to sleep tonight.

357
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19.280
Well, at my house.

358
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21.280
In prison.

359
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24.960
Yeah. I'm going to put you in a nice little cell.

360
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27.720
We don't have to… I'm gonna put you with the pedophiles.

361
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29.120
What? Yes.

362
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32.440
You know what they do to pedophiles in the shower room?

363
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35.880
Do you know the diameter of your asshole? Beg your pardon?

364
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37.720
I'm asking if you know the width of your anus.

365
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40.160
I understood the question. I didn't mean for you to repeat it.

366
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41.440
So you tell me where he is.

367
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44.080
I'll count to three. After that, I'll tase you.

368
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45.080
One.

369
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46.760
Listen to me.  Where is he? Two.

370
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49.040
Soweto. South Africa! Tase this piece of shit.

371
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55.960
Give it.

372
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06.440
Uh, he could…

373
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11.680
He's close to kicking the bucket, even.

374
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13.400
Wow, it's already dead. Look.

375
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15.680
There's no more juice, which is perfect.

376
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16.680
We can leave.

377
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18.480
This thing could use some fresh batteries.

378
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20.200
I'll change the battery. Go find him now.

379
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21.680
I'm on it. Quick, quick, quick!

380
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31.040
Doesn't smell like hope, huh, little man?

381
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32.320
Smells like shit.

382
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39.960
Empower the people!  Empower the people!

383
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43.240
Get down. Get down.

384
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46.360
There are cops everywhere. What do we do?

385
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48.120
We should go hide in the 'hood.

386
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50.680
That's a good idea, come on. Let's take the Métro. It's not far.

387
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52.560
There are security cameras everywhere in there.

388
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53.800
Exactly. Stop it.

389
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56.200
Who's ever gotten arrested by a security camera in the Métro?

390
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57.640
Lots of guys, actually.

391
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59.240
Huh?  That's what it's for.

392
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01.080
They can zoom in and everything. You sure?

393
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02.480
Yeah.

394
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04.080
Really? Okay.

395
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09.280
Guys, why don't we go to Corinne's? She can hide us in her village.

396
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12.000
How, though? Paris is on lockdown.  Come on, let's cross.

397
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14.040
Hey, hey, hey…

398
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15.440
Come on, Mo, hide me!

399
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17.640
I won't spill the beans on his whereabouts.

400
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20.240
Mr. President?

401
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25.880
No, no, no, I look a lot like him, but I swear it's not me!

402
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28.480
You're really pushing it, man.

403
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31.160
I don't have the words…  Sorry, sorry.

404
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34.480
Mr. President, we support you. We know the news is fake. It's all good.

405
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36.160
Yeah, hop on. We can hide you.

406
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38.600
No, no, no, no. Who says you won't report us?

407
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42.160
I thought solutions came from below?

408
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49.720
Alice?

409
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52.880
What's the matter? Come on, you can go now.

410
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55.480
No, I have to stay with you and ensure your safety, Mr. President.

411
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58.560
My safety. That's a pretty big word, no offense.

412
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00.880
Go. It's an order. You can go.

413
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06.080
Wow. Okay.

414
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09.880
By the way, it's kind of lame to have an air vent

415
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12.080
leading straight into the bunker, isn't it?

416
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15.560
Yeah, it's true, it's not very smart, not at all, but it's…

417
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18.560
Well, it's a French bunker. Can't I stay with you, Mr. President?

418
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20.400
No, you can't. Good luck, Alice.

419
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21.720
Farewell, Mr. President.

420
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23.560
Good luck. No "farewell." That's too dramatic.

421
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26.280
["Gasolina (feat. Gambi)" by Hamza playing]

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46.440
Why are we stopping here?

423
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48.120
We live here.

424
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52.560
We found the president's phone in a trash can.

425
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54.680
In a trash can? Mmhmm.

426
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57.800
He could be anywhere by now.

427
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00.840
No, I don't think he could. Everyone would recognize him.

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04.440
I bet he's hiding at home. I don't see anywhere else.

429
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10.040
If he went home, he's on our turf.

430
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12.520
So get everybody on it.

431
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17.000
Any law enforcement officer, drug dealer, or kebab vendor.

432
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20.360
Provide a substantial subsidy to anyone who locates him.

433
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24.440
General, you're going to put the city on lockdown.

434
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28.400
Lock down the whole city. State of emergency.

435
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30.560
Nobody comes in, nobody comes out.

436
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36.600
A new development in the crisis that is shaking the country.

437
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40.640
Prime Minister Eric Andréï has declared a state of emergency in the capital,

438
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43.800
which will last until President Blé has been found.

439
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48.640
Parisians are thus ordered to stay home until further notice.

440
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07.960
There.

441
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12.240
Thank you. No, thank you.

442
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15.000
We live here thanks to your project.

443
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17.320
Your "Living Together" project, Mr. President.

444
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19.440
I used to live in a highrise crib.

445
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21.760
A what? Highrise crib.

446
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24.520
Um, what the hell is that? Lowincome apartment.

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27.440
Ah. Yes, that's what I said. Yeah.

448
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29.520
Now the kids have a lot more room to play, you know?

449
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31.200
Hmm. We're mleh.

450
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33.800
Here. Thanks. Thanks.

451
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36.640
All right, I've got to go to work. Make yourselves at home, okay?

452
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39.000
Thank you so much.  Good luck, Mr. President.

453
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40.600
Thanks.

454
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43.240
So? I talked to my guy. It's taken care of.

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44.840
All right. Uh…

456
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48.120
There's a boat waiting for us in Beauvais. In 24 hours, we're in Abidjan.

457
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49.280
Huh?

458
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50.800
A boat? Yeah.

459
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53.000
In Beauvais? Sorry, I couldn't find one any closer.

460
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54.600
So it's in Beauvais. You sure?

461
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56.360
Well, I looked. I couldn't find one.

462
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58.040
I can't accept your stupidity anymore.

463
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59.840
Huh? There's no sea in Beauvais.

464
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01.520
What? Yeah, Mo, everyone knows that.

465
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04.120
Hold on, should we be focusing on this little detail?

466
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06.920
Come on. When, then if not now? Can't we talk about that later?

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09.040
Don't we have more pressing matters?

468
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11.880
Also, my guy wants to be paid up front, so deal with it.

469
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14.360
Oh man.

470
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21.560
Are you okay?

471
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23.720
I truly apologize.

472
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28.160
When I married you, all I wanted was a dramafree life.

473
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29.600
And now we're fugitives.

474
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35.200
Listen, when I married you, I knew it was gonna be a mess.

475
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38.400
I signed up for it.

476
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41.600
You didn't sign up for this.

477
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46.240
But I signed up.  Come check this out!

478
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53.240
Do you realize? He wanted to fire at peaceful protesters.

479
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56.200
I'm sure if you spend that much time supporting jihadists,

480
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57.800
you wind up using their methods.

481
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01.240
Huh? Jihadists? Why not terrorists? I call for Stéphane Blé's impeachment.

482
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03.080
And I'm asking for new presidential elections,

483
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06.880
so France and the French people can return to a peaceful and safe state.

484
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10.240
Stéphane Blé is gullible. He's a coward. And he's weak, of course.

485
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12.680
She's exaggerating a little. Also, misogynistic.

486
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14.760
It's too much.  Don't do this.

487
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16.920
He would've never given the order to fire at the crowd.

488
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20.560
The president remains nowhere to be found, and civil society has rallied up.

489
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21.880
Supermarket cashiers,

490
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24.680
delivery drivers, taxi drivers, maintenance staff,

491
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28.840
everyone threatens to block the country if Stéphane Blé is impeached.

492
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31.840
You see? France isn't against you.

493
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34.800
…spontaneous protests are taking place in support of the president.

494
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37.800
Can we send a message directly on the Élysée's account?

495
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39.920
Mmhmm. All right, go ahead and film me, please.

496
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45.200
Dear French citizens,

497
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47.760
this is Stéphane Blé speaking, your president.

498
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49.280
Let me be clear with you.

499
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52.360
I never ordered to open fire on the crowd.

500
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56.360
Andréï is portraying me as a scumbag. I'll prove to you that I'm innocent.

501
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58.720
And for that, I'll need everyone.

502
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02.280
You, me, him, her, and even they too.

503
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03.320
Just keep going.

504
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04.800
I am moving on.

505
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09.440
I need for everyone to rise up and root for me.

506
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10.880
They wanna destroy me.

507
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13.360
Stéphane is broadcasting a live message. We found the signal.

508
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16.200
He's in an apartment five minutes away. Okay, perfect.

509
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21.960
Send in special forces, SWAT teams, a few fighter jets if we have to.

510
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24.920
If he must fall, he will fall.

511
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25.920
Mmhmm.

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29.800
That way, he'll get to join his 70 virgins ahead of schedule.

513
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32.560
Funny, but I don't think he's a Muslim. What would he be, then?

514
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34.520
An animist?

515
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36.360
Huh?  An animist.

516
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38.360
What are the animists promised?

517
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40.720
Must be cars.

518
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43.160
Cars. Trinkets, maybe. Anyway, who gives a fuck?

519
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44.200
Go for it. Get out.

520
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47.200
What are animists promised?

521
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49.600
Dear French citizens.

522
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52.480
All Andréï wants is to set us against each other.

523
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55.360
Police! Give yourself up!

524
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57.040
But we're better than that.

525
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59.400
Right now, it's not about me as a person.

526
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01.400
We don't care about me. You have elected me.

527
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03.440
Hands in the air!  Right now…

528
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04.560
Ah!

529
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06.560
…it's your choice that's being stolen.

530
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11.200
I've decided to protect my loved ones.

531
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13.520
They shouldn't be the ones paying for this.

532
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16.880
What is she doing? Marion, Marion, stop it. We have to go.

533
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19.280
But I'm gonna fight.

534
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23.960
Because our democracy is sick, and it's up to us to take good care of it.

535
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25.200
No one else.

536
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27.120
So we won't go down without a fight.

537
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28.080
We won't give up,

538
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30.840
just like the Doc Gynéco song, for those who remember.

539
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33.920
I truly encourage everyone to join together.

540
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36.400
Let's restore the dignity of our nation, France.

541
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41.520
This is why I urge all French citizens to join me in the fight.

542
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44.520
People from cities, the countryside, everywhere.

543
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46.680
Those who work. Those who are unemployed.

544
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49.360
People of all ethnicities, of all sexualities.

545
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52.360
Straight, bi, gays, asexuals, those who never do it.

546
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57.280
Alone, we are powerless. But together, we are unbeatable.

547
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01.160
Long live France. Long live the resistance mleh.

548
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04.480
No two ways about it. I'll be back.

549
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07.320
All together. All together. Yeah. Yeah.
