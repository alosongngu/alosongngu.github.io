1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11.520
So, we pieced together the events of their night.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15.080
It starts at 7:30 p.m., dinner at the Rose Garden restaurant.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19.120
Then they booked a spa treatment at the Blue Parrot at 10:18 p.m.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21.120
Then they went back to the presidential suite,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22.400
where they ordered… Ah.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26.400
…a bottle of champagne around 12:11 a.m.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29.040
Then we completely lost contact with them at 2:33 a.m.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31.360
I don't give a shit about what they were doing!

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33.880
What I want is to find her, to know where she is.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35.880
Very well, but I can't know everything so…

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37.560
Send in anyone you want. I don't care.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40.400
SWAT teams, the army, or anyone else who can get the job done.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41.360
I just need her found.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42.760
Sorry to interrupt,

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47.400
but, uh, if they drank a whole bottle of champagne

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50.000
and then, uh, turned off their phones at 2:30 a.m.,

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52.000
maybe there's another angle to consider. No. No.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52.920
No.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53.960
There is.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55.800
No, Yasmine, you're mistaken.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57.520
You're mistaken. He's gay.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58.480
Exactly.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01.200
I'm sorry, you're completely incorrect. He's not gay at all.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02.760
Yeah, for sure, he's totally gay.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04.640
I hired him. I know what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05.800
I know what I saw in him.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08.800
Then again, I'm thinking, the First Lady being kidnapped,

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11.320
from an electoral point of view, it's incredible.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14.080
People feel sorry for him. They vote for him again. It's great.

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18.560
What? don't look at me like I'm some asshole, all right?

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20.640
It's a strategy like any other. It's not that bad.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22.400
We'd secure reelection, no doubt about it.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24.080
No matter what, this can't be leaked

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27.560
because if the people who kidnapped her hear about this, they might freak out.

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29.520
They could send us an ear through the post mail.

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32.600
Or a toe. That's what I would do. Send a toe.

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34.040
For what?

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35.760
If you're missing a toe, you can't escape.

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38.040
True. He's right. If you're missing a foot, maybe.

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40.600
A missing toe, you can still run. It'll affect your balance.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43.880
You can't run as well, but you can run. But without an ear, you'd stagger, zigzag.

42
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45.000
No, that's for cats.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47.080
I can cut off your ear, see how you deal with it.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48.640
I got it. I'll go find them myself.

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm sorry, but you can't disappear like that.

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52.960
You have to take care of the upcoming elections from here.

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54.480
What will I tell them if you're gone?

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56.440
Tell them I'm campaigning in the West Indies.

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58.520
You take care of Andréï. You're coming with me.

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01.760
No, because I believe that I'm much more useful on the mainland.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03.960
It would be a good idea for Yasmine to accompany you.

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05.440
And I'll deal with Andréï.

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07.160
Aren't you from the West Indies?

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10.160
I'm from Grands Fonds SainteAnne. It's like an island within an island.

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13.120
Almost a different Creole language. These guys don't understand each other.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14.640
You're coming.  Yeah, okay.

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16.280
Can I come with?  No.

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19.720
We have to go with someone else. Someone who knows the ghetto well.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22.760
I know someone, but you won't like it.

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23.840
Who do you know?

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24.760
Someone.

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26.280
Who is it?

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27.960
Uh, I can't say.

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30.560
Say it.

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31.800
I won't say it.

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33.640
Well, we're gonna find out. Just shoot.

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35.040
No, no, it's a secret.

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37.480
How old are you? What kind of secret is that?

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39.160
I have a secret. I'm gonna tell a secret.

70
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40.360
No, don't say it.

71
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42.680
I'm gonna tell a secret too.  No, don't say it.

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45.240
Fine. Tell your secret first. After, I'll tell mine. Not.

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46.360
How old are you, Mo?

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47.480
Um…

75
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48.480
36 years old.

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51.160
Wow, he actually had to think and do the math.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54.160
REPRESENT

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06.240
Mr. Désiré Guigui.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08.000
Quit the namedropping, dude.

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10.720
Oh yeah.

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13.280
All right.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14.960
President, huh?

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17.120
You made it, my man.

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18.760
Yeah, but here's the thing…

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20.200
I won't lie to you, though.

86
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22.640
The inauguration thing kind of hurt my feelings.

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25.240
You could've sent me an invite. We're family.

88
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27.360
You kidding? After the crazy shit you pulled on me?

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29.480
Are we family or not?  We're family.

90
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32.080
I couldn't. Get over it. You could've… invited me.

91
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33.040
Yeah.

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35.000
All right, it's okay. No worries. I'm here.

93
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38.080
You gonna give me the tour? No, I don't have time for that.

94
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40.760
We think Marion has been kidnapped in Guadeloupe with her bodyguard.

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41.840
Oh my God.

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45.040
And?

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47.960
I know you know lots of people there, I thought you could help me out.

98
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50.720
Oh, I see. All right. So you didn't want to see me.

99
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53.160
I'm here to lend a hand. No, it's great to see you, Désiré.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55.160
Stop it, come on. It's always the same with you.

101
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56.080
Listen up, bro.

102
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58.280
Guadeloupe right now, it's chaotic over there.

103
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59.320
It's not welcoming.

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01.000
Oh yeah? Think the street is bad here?

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02.480
It's a playground compared to there.

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06.200
They don't have streets. It's a jungle. You hear gunshots at breakfast. At dawn.

107
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07.320
Bang! Oh fuck.

108
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09.840
Where and when exactly did she disappear?

109
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13.600
She disappeared at two in the morning in a hotel called the Blue Parrot.

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15.120
Hmm. I'll help you out.

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17.320
No worries. Got guys over there and everything.

112
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18.360
We can go, no problem.

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20.320
But we have to take the presidential plane.

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21.600
Gotta save time, you know?

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23.600
In terms of security and customs, all that.

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25.040
Yeah. Round trip, though?

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27.200
Yeah. Like, for real?

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

119
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31.520
Thanks a lot, coz. Seriously, man.

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34.440
No problem, brother. We family. We family.

121

♪ I don't wanna wake up ♪

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58.000
I've got shivers. I'm home.

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59.200
All right, guys.

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01.720
I have a couple of phone calls to make real quick.

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03.800
I'll meet you at the hotel, all right?

127
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05.960
We don't have much here, but we give.

128
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07.240
We're generous.

129
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09.440
They don't have shoes, they walk barefoot.

130
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10.680
But they give. They give.

131
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12.280
Son of a bitch!

132

What did he say?

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17.160
"Counia manmanw." It's, um…

134
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18.680
Like, "I know your mother."

135
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20.080
Oh, cool.  Yeah.

136
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21.880
Counia manmanw!  Thanks.

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27.840
These accras are too spicy.

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31.360
I think the heat is starting to affect my vocal cords, aren't they?

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35.680
Are you sure you don't want to try one? Accras, anyone?

140
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38.560
No. All right, listen up, we go straight to the hotel

141
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40.000
to see if we can get any intel.

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41.120
I want to find her quick.

143
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42.080
What's this?

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44.560
My West Indies are here to greet you.

145
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50.440
Are you sure about that? They seem pretty pissed off.

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53.880
Yeah, they're pissed off, but with good vibes.

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56.960
WILL YOU ADDRESS OUR PROBLEMS?

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00.040
Here, it's Everything's very exuberant, colorful. It's very…

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02.360
Okay, please, talk to them. Tell them to calm down, please.

150
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04.040
Me? Yeah, go ahead.

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07.240
Been a while since I've spoken Creole. I speak the old Creole.

152
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10.000
Talk to them. Tell them to calm down. Yeah, all right. I'll do it.

153
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11.640
Um…

154
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13.560
"Listen…" Okay, wait. Hold on.

155
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16.120
Okay, okay.

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18.440
Resignation! Whoa!

157
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20.000
Hey, calm down!

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26.080
They seem really angry. What is it they're asking for?

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27.800
We speak English, sir.

160
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30.840
These guys, there's the president, he's good.

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32.560
Hey yo! Watch out now!

162
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34.520
Is it broken? Where?

163
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37.440
All right. I'm going to speak to the president,

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40.120
to see if he wants to hear your requests, all right?

165
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44.320
They're not being receptive. Come on, let's get out of here.

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47.000
The guy's hand was this close to me. Like, I mean, like, one inch.

167
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49.040
Please get out of the way, let me do it.

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51.240
What are you doing? The dude in orange is nuts.

169
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56.120
The president will speak now. Today.

170
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58.280
Listen up. Thank you.

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02.440
What's wrong? What's happening, brothers?

172
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04.800
What do you mean, "my brothers"? You're Ivorian, man.

173
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07.880
Oh. Whoa. Okay, fair enough. Yeah, it's true.

174
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10.960
But I'm also the president, all right? I know there are some problems here.

175
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12.920
I came for that reason, to resolve everything.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15.520
And it starts with your votes at the legislative elections,

177
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17.880
if you want me to be able to take action, all right?

178
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20.000
We're gonna vote. We're gonna vote for Cognard.

179
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22.600
Cognard! Cognard! Cognard! Cognard!

180
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Have you lost your damn mind?

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27.160
You don't know how crazy that fool is? Of course we do.

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29.360
In fact, he's… He's like us. He's angry.

183
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31.960
Yeah, you talk and talk, but you don't do anything.

184
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35.120
About the chlordecone. What will you do about that?

185
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40.520
I don't understand. What's chlordecone?

186
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43.480
It's Creole. It means…

187
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45.520
Something like… "It's totally insane."

188
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47.720
It's "chlordinsane." All right, makes more sense.

189
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48.800
Hold on.

190
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51.800
It's a pesticide that's poisoning us.

191
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53.800
Ah, it means that too. Good to know.  Andy!

192
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56.040
Come here and show him your colon cancer.

193
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57.200
I don't want to.

194
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58.960
Get undressed right now!

195
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01.080
Take it off! Take it off! Come on!

196
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05.280
No, no, no. We have to get out of here.

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08.040
Start the car, start the car! Come on! Come on, come on. Come on!

198
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10.720
Mr. Prime Minister,

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14.600
I admit that we've all been displeased by the animosity of Mrs. Douanier,

200
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15.840
your predecessor.

201
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17.560
Or should I say predecesstress?

202
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21.080
In her case, the masculine prevails, in my opinion.

203
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24.160
Thanks.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27.960
About the president's desire to withdraw troops from Africa,

205
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30.720
I personally think it's pure madness.

206
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35.000
It's not pure madness, General.

207
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37.000
It's complete bullshit.

208
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40.960
This whole notion of their repentance is absurd.

209
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45.640
Colonization.

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50.520
No. I don't side with that camp.

211
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51.440
Mm.

212
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52.880
Good to hear.

213
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55.400
However, General…

214
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59.280
for quite some time now,

215
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03.400
I've been hearing certain rumors that are…

216
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05.400
very unsettling.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10.280
A kind of anger that rumbles and frightens me.

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12.760
So I was wondering.

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15.760
Will you be able to keep a cool head

220
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19.040
when the time comes to choose between order

221
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21.520
and chaos?

222
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25.600
Chaos? Chaos.

223
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29.680
Whether it comes from the street or perhaps from the Élysée.

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36.200
As commander in chief of the armed forces, I owe him my loyalty.

225
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37.960
I know all this, but…

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41.160
But if France was ever in danger…

227
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45.240
I would always side with France.

228
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47.720
I mean, the real France.

229
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53.720
That's a relief for me.

230
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54.720
Good.

231
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57.840
Let's go see those CAESAR howitzers. Everyone says they're great.

232
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58.760
Be my guest.

233
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04.920
Mo, you'll check the hotel security cameras.

234
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05.840
Okay.

235
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08.040
Come with me, William. We'll search her room.

236
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10.680
Good idea, but first, I have to deal with something.

237
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12.440
You're coming.  Okay.

238
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13.680
BLUE PARROT HOTEL &amp; SPA

239
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45.240
What the fuck?

240
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51.840
No, no.

241
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57.880
Oh no.

242
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12.000
Jesus Christ.

243
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12.920
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16.040
Damn it, that knocked me out.

245
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18.280
Whoa! Whoa! Ooh!

246
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20.680
Wow. I'm not sure what they're adding to the accras anymore,

247
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22.680
but they don't taste like the West Indies I know.

248
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25.080
Sorry for the… I couldn't find anything.

249
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27.640
Yeah, me neither. It's started to affect my vocal cords.

250
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29.200
Oh my God. Yeah, yeah. I know.

251
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30.480
What's wrong with you?

252
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32.680
I just… You need to get a full checkup in Paris.

253
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36.280
I can't eat Creole cuisine. Not just the food. You got a problem.

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38.560
You think? Anyway, I've got the rest of our program.

255
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40.800
Yeah. Hold up. I know what it is, William.

256
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42.240
What? We're gonna find Marion.

257
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44.440
We're gonna look for Marion, that's for sure.

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47.440
But now, the top priority is the legislative elections.

259
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50.920
All right? It's the campaign. The campaign, the campaign, okay?

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53.280
So I've set up a visit to this dope little distillery.

261
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55.800
It's gonna be great, you'll see. Enough with the clichés.

262
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58.640
We're in the West Indies, so it's all about the rum and zouk now.

263
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01.320
Is that all? Since we're here, let's do something useful.

264
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03.240
Like, how about we go to PointeàPitre

265
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05.240
and inaugurate a memorial for Aimé Césaire?

266
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08.240
Something that holds significance for us. I see. I'm the one with clichés?

267
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11.280
The epitome of the French West Indies cliché is that dude.

268
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13.760
And plus, I can't stand Aimé Césaire.

269
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15.840
Are you serious? I thought you were his greatnephew.

270
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18.480
I am his greatnephew. So what? It's no excuse.

271
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20.080
He's created negritude.

272
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22.440
Don't you have any issues with that?

273
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24.400
As if an Arab came up with Arabitude,

274
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26.720
or a Jew with Jewitude.

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29.760
Yeah. Isn't it absurd?

276
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32.080
That's not my West Indies. What are your West Indies?

277
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34.120
I'll tell you. Fine, it's, uh…

278
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37.840
My West Indies, it's the guys with the broken teeth.

279
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40.440
A bit like… Hang on a sec. Yeah?

280
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43.040
Who is it? What the fuck? It's crazy.

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45.520
Come on. Fuck.

282
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47.360
Go ahead.  William, you there?

283
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49.160
Yeah, Mo. Any updates?  Yeah.

284
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50.840
Man, it's fucked up. It's fucked up.

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53.560
Is there news?  Marion hooked up with her bodyguard.

286
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55.280
Get out of here.  Honest to God.

287
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56.760
Any news? Huh?

288
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58.080
Any news? No news.

289
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59.480
He didn't find anything.

290
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02.040
There's nothing.  What do you mean?

291
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03.440
I told you Aimé fucked Marion.

292
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05.400
Okay, awesome. Awesome. That's awesome, man.

293
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07.800
Does he have news or not?  Don't you understand?

294
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10.600
Aimé fucked the First Lady, damn it! He screwed the president's wife.

295
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12.000
Sounds good. Hold on.

296
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14.680
He wants to know where we're eating, because he's already hungry.

297
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15.880
He'd like to eat chicken.

298
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18.360
We don't give a shit about chicken. Forget about the chicken.

299
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20.320
What? We're looking for Marion, man.

300
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21.240
I'm not hungry.

301
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23.680
Take three chickens for you,

302
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26.520
and we'll have one lobster, one grilled fish, and some accras.

303
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28.880
No! No accras. Please, not that!  Accras?

304
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30.720
What the fuck are you You're the best.

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32.440
This guy is obsessed with food.

306
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33.600
Désiré has an update.

307
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35.480
What is it? All right, let's go meet him.

308
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37.560
Don't get too close to the bathroom door.

309
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42.040
It's beautiful.

310
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45.680
Check that out. The Jet Skis, the guys having a blast.

311
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47.640
We're in the middle of the week, man.

312
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49.840
We think we're living that fancy Parisian life,

313
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51.680
and then, bam, you witness this.

314
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54.480
What's that?

315
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58.080
It's nothing. Some presents for the homies. It's…

316
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00.560
Soft toys. You're a good friend.

317
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02.200
Uh, so we localized Marion.

318
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05.560
She was last seen at 3:00 a.m. with her bodyguard, getting inside a car.

319
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08.640
Uh, but, uh, she didn't seem to be consensual.

320
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09.800
Oh, fuck!

321
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13.400
As long as she didn't consent, it's all right.

322
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15.040
It's all right.

323
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21.960
It's fucked up, but we're moving forward.

324
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26.000
Anyway, my guy's getting some intel, and in an hour he'll get back to me.

325
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27.680
All right, cool. Okay. Great.

326
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29.840
It gives us time to go make your speech.

327
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30.800
Let's move.

328
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33.400
No, sorry, I don't feel like it at all right now.

329
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35.920
Let's go, Stéphane. Bring up the "living together" concept.

330
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39.600
Um, Guadeloupe getting worse and worse, into near fourthworld status.

331
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41.520
"But we're gonna fix this." Blah, blah, blah.

332
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44.320
Then we take photos and go. Think about the legislative elections.

333
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45.600
Let's go.

334
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48.680
Can I take one of the plushies? I have a friend here who has a child.

335
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50.240
How old? Six years old.

336
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51.520
Only six? No, man.

337
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53.120
It's not plushies suitable for his age.

338
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55.800
These plushies are something else, you know?

339
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57.400
Ah.  They're plushies for…

340
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58.880
Adults?  Yeah, for adults.

341
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00.600
Okay.  Okay what?

342
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03.000
No, I'm sorry. I thought that, uh…  Mmhmm.

343
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04.120
You understand, right?

344
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12.520
Mr. Mayor.

345
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16.280
Hello, everyone.

346
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20.600
I know you don't like me, like most French people at the moment.

347
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25.160
I was elected, it's true.

348
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28.680
And I thought that that was the hardest part, but it's not.

349
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32.480
We know damn well, and it's no secret, that as Black folks,

350
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34.520
we receive no respect and are often ignored.

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35.640
Yeah.

352
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38.200
If you vote for me in the legislative elections,

353
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40.160
I'll bring this message to the world.

354
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43.040
And so, "My mouth speaks for those who cannot,

355
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46.080
my voice represents the freedom of the hopeless."

356
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52.240
It's a quote by Aimé Césaire, people.

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53.960
Fuck Aimé Césaire!

358
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58.080
Told you, Mr. President. Césaire is from Martinique.

359
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59.320
We are in Guadeloupe.

360
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01.920
White people always do this to us. It's a pain in the ass.

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04.360
Exactly. It's a pain in the ass bigtime.

362
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07.000
Did you mean to take on their accent or make fun of them?

363
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10.080
You're out of line. Quit the whole "trying to be cool" thing.

364
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15.240
AIMÉ CÉSAIRE SQUARE

365
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22.920
I got good and bad news, cousin. Okay, what's the good news?

366
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25.960
Marion got snatched up by those Békés. Fuck.

367
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28.880
Because of her tax proposal. They took her to an isolated spot.

368
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30.960
They're holding her. It's gonna be very tricky.

369
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33.800
I only half agree, because it's the Békés. They should be pretty gentle.

370
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36.120
All right, so it looks like we've got nothing but bad news.

371
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39.080
What's the good news? The good news is, well, she's alive.

372
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41.960
That's two good newses for me. Look at the bright side.

373
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44.040
She was taken by the Békés, not independentists.

374
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45.680
We should be all right…  Hey!

375
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47.760
They're extremists, these guys are crazy.

376
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50.560
Listen to me, I'm gonna roll with my crew and handle this, no problem.

377
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52.280
You have 70% chance to get her back.

378
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53.200
Alive?

379
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55.600
Alive, 30% chance.

380
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57.680
Come on, stop it. What's so funny?

381
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00.320
Are you listening to yourself? You're talking nonsense.

382
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01.560
They're Békés, guys.

383
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04.280
They're as gentle as lambs.  Gentle? They're fucking awful.

384
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05.800
These guys are terrible.

385
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07.880
Yeah, there was a time when these men became wealthy

386
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09.640
off the backs of Black people in ship holds.

387
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12.040
They did let people die of thirst in sugarcane fields.

388
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14.280
He's full of shit.  Hear me out. They evolved.

389
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17.440
Now the 2.0 Békés variant is… Mwah! Seriously?

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19.760
They have a sense of friendship, a work ethic.

391
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22.840
I'm telling you, we're judging them based on a past that's maybe questionable,

392
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25.080
even though they did do some cool stuff.

393
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27.080
And now we're saying they're awful? I'm shocked.

394
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28.800
Okay, let's cut the shit out.

395
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30.800
I'm calling in the pros now. I'm done.

396
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33.120
I'm telling you, dude… You're a friend of the Békés, huh?

397
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34.720
I'm not a friend of the Békés… Yeah.

398
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36.560
…but I am keeping an open mind. I'm just

399
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39.160
I'll introduce you if you're cool with it. I know a crew of Békés.

400
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41.040
I mean, I swear, these guys are… I'm in, man.

401
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43.120
Are there girls too?

402
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45.360
Let's call Alice to see what she can do.

403
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47.800
Even though, I gotta admit… Ugh!

404
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49.720
So I studied the area,

405
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52.880
and the success rate of the mission is 60%.

406
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54.720
Wait, 60% if she's alive?

407
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57.520
No, uh…

408
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59.480
Alive, it's 20%.

409
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02.440
What are you talking about? Even Désiré had estimated 30%.

410
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03.400
You see?

411
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05.040
Well, I'm not sure.

412
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06.400
I'd trust him if I were you.

413
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09.440
I don't know who he is, but he seems good.

414
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10.440
I kinda like her.

415
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12.480
There's no choice. We gotta handle this ourselves.

416
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15.200
You're not going anywhere. You're staying here. You're the president.

417
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17.920
I don't care, I'll tell them to take me as hostage instead of Marion.

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20.160
Mr. President, you can't do that. It's suicidal.

419
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21.840
Of course, I'm right. You can't do that.

420
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24.520
Above all, it's very heroic, Mr. President.

421
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26.920
Wait, wait, what the hell is that guy doing here?

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28.920
"That guy" is your prime minister,

423
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31.240
and everything that happens to you, happens to me.

424
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32.280
You know that.

425
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35.640
I don't understand the defiance you feel toward me.

426
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37.160
Oh yeah? But I don't blame you.

427
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39.080
It's your own flesh and blood being threatened.

428
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41.920
Congratulations on your decision. It's very brave.

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43.480
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

430
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46.040
There's something Gaullist about the decisions you make.

431
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48.600
This dude.  What the fuck.

432
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51.400
Okay. Got the address?

433
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53.040
Yeah, buddy. The war is on.

434
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55.640
We're going ourselves. Let's go.

435
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57.200
It's gonna be tough, but we'll do it.

436
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00.960
Obviously, the president is blinded by sadness.

437
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02.840
We would be too.

438
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07.600
Either way, we need to take strong action with these terrorists.

439
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08.760
What terrorists?

440
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11.920
The Béké. We must take quick action.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15.160
I don't want the tragic events of November 13 to happen again.

442
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18.200
Never again. I lost a cousin when that happened.

443
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19.880
Really?  Yeah.

444
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20.840
Hm.

445
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25.240
Excuse me.

446
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28.680
Your cousin…

447
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31.360
On what side was he?

448
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33.640
On my mother's side.

449
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36.760
No, I mean, what side? Was he with…

450
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38.640
You know…

451
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41.840
Or…

452
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42.760
"Ah!"

453
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49.000
It's a legitimate question.  Yes.

454
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50.240
Wait, are you serious?

455
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55.360
Either way, either way, the Republic will not negotiate with such terrorists.

456
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59.320
I'll go get them all the way down the shithole.

457
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01.240
What about the president?

458
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02.640
Glory be with him.

459
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05.040
Can you leave me for a few minutes, please?

460
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10.520
Unbelievable.

461
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11.960
Thanks.

462
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16.880
Yes, General, it's me.

463
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21.520
There's a crisis in PointeàPitre. Let's do something big and forceful.

464
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28.640
Fuck.

465
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39.480
It's magnificent.

466
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43.920
Magnificent. Incredible.

467
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46.680
Look, they hired locals.

468
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54.600
Yeah, Patricia, look where I am.

469
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56.240
It's our dream house.

470
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59.880
This place is crazy. There's so much room. It's amazing.

471
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12.560
Nice to meet you.

472
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14.160
Clément Robicheaux.

473
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17.200
Guadeloupean since 1683.

474
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19.920
Stéphane Blé. President of France.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20.880
I know.

476
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22.640
Now that we're here, you can release Marion.

477
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24.080
Well, release…

478
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26.080
She's not exactly held hostage.

479
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28.920
She kinda is, man.

480
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34.240
Who's this Black guy who thinks he's free to talk a lot?

481
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35.520
What'd he just say? Chill.

482
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37.840
No, it's okay, calm down. Chill out. We're among gentlemen,

483
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39.440
Everything's gonna be all right.

484
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40.920
Yeah. No worries.

485
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42.720
Come on, follow me.

486
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44.720
I can feel it. Shit is gonna hit the fan.

487
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47.480
Calm down. Calm down, guys. Chill out, Désiré.

488
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49.480
Chill out. Calm down.

489
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50.720
Good evening.

490
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53.920
It's so magnificent.

491
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55.800
The columns and everything.

492
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57.400
Ahem, Mr. President.

493
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01.040
For us, the Béké tax you're trying to ratify,

494
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02.640
I'll tell you what I think.

495
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05.080
For us, it's just one more insult

496
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07.720
that we can't tolerate, okay?

497
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11.360
Hold on, let me explain because I don't want to seem unlikable.

498
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13.440
We've done our part, you know?

499
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15.560
We freed the… the "slaves."

500
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16.480
All right?

501
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17.840
We did it gladly.

502
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19.920
We had to pay up, but it's all good.

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22.920
That was nice of you, thanks.  Yeah. You're welcome.

504
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25.640
So, what's the big reward for all our efforts?

505
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30.200
First of all, alarmingly high levels of unemployment.

506
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31.480
Not related. Right?

507
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33.960
Yeah, but populations are undereducated,

508
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38.240
A majority of people are illiterate and can't do basic arithmetic.

509
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40.320
I even wonder if they know they exist.

510
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42.920
For some of them, do they even have a conscience?

511
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45.840
Right? That's a question we're entitled to ask.

512
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47.960
Then there's rampant insecurity.

513
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51.080
Forgive me for saying so, but delinquency's knocking at our doors.

514
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53.960
The road up front is a disaster.  Hm.

515
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56.680
They drive their horsedrawn carriages on the sidewalks.

516
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58.280
Hm. Fuck!

517
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59.560
Hm. Fuck!

518
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02.080
This has to stop. Okay with you?  Hmm.

519
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04.440
It's enough. We've had enough.

520
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06.240
Also, to add insult to the injury,

521
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08.600
the media consistently portray us as deplorable.

522
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13.320
Have you noticed the influx of films that are about the servitudes of slaves?

523
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17.480
They depict us, without exception, as evil.

524
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18.480
Not necessarily.

525
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20.920
For example, I'm thinking of a masterpiece.

526
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22.880
Gone with the Wind. Have you seen it, sir?

527
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24.400
No.  You're well portrayed.

528
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26.080
What about you? Watch it. It's fabulous.

529
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28.280
I'll check it out. Extraordinary.

530
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32.440
Let's be serious for a second. Can we just agree on the fact

531
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35.360
that slave owners and slaves are both wrong?

532
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38.680
Right? I mean, it's not because someone holds a whip

533
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40.920
like they do on all the family pictures,

534
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42.800
that they're necessarily bastards.

535
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43.920
I mean, come on.

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46.520
You always wear chains around the neck in the photos

537
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48.560
with this look of, you know, "suffering,"

538
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51.760
which shows a real lack of modesty, if I may point that out.

539
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54.000
Hm.  Does that mean you're victims?

540
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56.400
The jury's still out. The jury is still out.

541
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00.360
I don't mean to interrupt but, look, I love the photos, they're incredible.

542
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01.760
However, the whip, it's still

543
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04.240
I mean, it's a mark of domination from your perspective.

544
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06.760
It's not, but that's beside the point. A little bit the point.

545
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09.440
Not all victims are the same. Okay, but…

546
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12.000
Not all victims are the same.  That's not really true.

547
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14.640
I'll be clear with you, I'm not asking for the moon,

548
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18.800
I'm asking for a little more nuance. There, is that too much to ask?

549
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22.960
So about the nuance, uh, business, I think it's a question of point of view.

550
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24.920
We've got ourselves some opposing views, yeah?

551
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27.680
However, about the Béké tax, by all means, let's talk.

552
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29.760
We're not talking anymore. Yeah, but let's avoid…

553
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31.680
I want to see my wife. Come on, um…

554
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32.920
Let's just talk.

555
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35.280
René, go get her.

556
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39.960
You speak Creole?  Of course.

557
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41.880
SCANNING IN PROGRESS…

558
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44.360
TARGET LOCATED

559
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50.400
We've arrived on site. Waiting for instructions.

560
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53.480
Making an omelet requires breaking eggs.

561
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56.360
Prime minister's order.

562
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58.360
Engage the target.

563
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00.920
Get rid of it all.

564
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03.040
Asking for order confirmation.

565
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06.840
The risk of collateral damage is high. The president could be among the victims.

566
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10.440
Order confirmed.

567
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12.680
Uh, Éric?

568
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15.080
Are we really doing this?

569
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17.840
He can run.

570
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22.760
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

571
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23.920
I'm fine, thanks.

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25.920
You, look at me, you filthy bastard.

573
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28.640
What do you think will happen? You can kill us? We won't give in.

574
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30.240
Chill.  Got it?

575
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32.000
Seriously, he's insane. He chained me.

576
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34.240
"Kill us"? Don't pay attention to her. She's lost it.

577
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36.400
She's only speaking for herself and doesn't really

578
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39.520
They're shooting!

579
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41.280
Where's that son of a bitch going?

580
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43.720
The terrorists either fled or have been neutralized.

581
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47.400
And no sign of the president. I repeat, no sign of the president.

582
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20.720
Terrorists have been neutralized.

583
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22.400
Mission accomplished, Prime Minister.

584
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24.240
Good news, the president is alive.

585
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32.200
William, before we leave, I want to talk to the locals.

586
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34.600
I've got something to announce. Can you set that up, please?

587
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36.600
Okay. And sorry again for what happened.

588
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39.000
That's not my French West Indies, you know?

589
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40.000
EAT WELL, FOR FREE

590
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41.840
Honestly, folks, prices here are insane.

591
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43.080
Straightup ridiculous.

592
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45.560
I understand why Guadeloupeans are angry.  Yeah!

593
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48.080
That's why I made the choice to launch here a pilot version

594
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50.800
of my "Eat well, for free" main measure.

595
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53.520
Because I want all the women and men of Guadeloupe

596
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55.640
to be able to eat healthy and for free from now on.

597
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00.400
All this will be financed by the Béké tax, led by my wonderful wife.

598
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06.120
And if the French people decide to trust me at the next elections,

599
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08.280
I'll extend the measure to the whole country.

600
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10.880
Ain't no time for games, you feel me? No unnecessary chatter.

601
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12.760
I'm gonna do it. Voilà.

602
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14.920
That asshole's not giving up.

603
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16.280
He may not wanna give up,

604
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18.280
but he's a cuckold.

605
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26.200
How about that.

606
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29.640
The First Lady of France is having fun.

607
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33.120
Who is it?

608
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34.360
Her bodyguard.

609
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35.640
No way. Yes.

610
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41.720
Send all of those, anonymously.

611
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44.720
Consider it done.

612
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46.960
Now I'm embarrassed by them, I swear.

613
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50.160
I don't recognize my homeland, my French West Indies.

614
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53.920
It used to be so fraternal there. There were Chinese, Indians, whites…

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55.360
All right, you can stop now. What?

616
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56.800
We know you're not from there.

617
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58.120
I… Me not

618
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01.880
Me not from the West Indies? Why the hell would you say that?

619
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07.720
Hello, Mr. President. Have a safe trip.

620
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09.360
Good and you?

621
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11.640
Seek, seek.

622
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15.960
Sorry, Mr. President, but there's a problem with that bag.

623
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18.120
Hold on, hold on. What's wrong with it? What's wrong?

624
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19.800
You see, she's a sniffer dog.

625
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23.400
If she gets excited like that, that means there's something in the bag.

626
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25.640
There could be some… You know, in the bag.

627
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27.840
I mean, like, you know, like, I guess…  What?

628
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29.320
They're plushies.  Sorry.

629
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30.880
Should I search the bag?

630
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32.760
It's the president. What are you talking about?

631
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35.880
What's wrong with you guys over here? What's your problem in the West Indies?

632
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37.760
Even the dogs are racists, is that it?

633
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39.800
Not at all, Mr. President, it's…

634
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42.240
Sit. Stop. That's not my France mleh at all.

635
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44.640
Not my France mleh. I'm sorry, Mr. President.

636
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47.160
These are soft plushies.

637
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50.040
Désiré said they're Creole plushies for adults to give away in the 'hood.

638
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53.280
Go ahead, Mr. President.  That dog is sniffing plushies.

639
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55.040
Thank you, coz. You're a fucking pain.

640
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57.320
I have something to share. You have to keep the secret.

641
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58.640
What? I'm Turkish.

642
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00.880
Just as I suspected. From Izmir?

643
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02.360
No, from Bodrum. Ah, all right.

644
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04.280
You have to come visit. My whole family's there.

645
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05.720
You'll be welcome with open arms.

646
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24.040
NEW VIDEO MESSAGE

647
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33.160
RESIGN OR THIS GETS OUT
