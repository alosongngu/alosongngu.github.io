1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20.280
Even if our "Eat well, for free" initiative has won over Guadeloupe,

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22.320
we're still trailing in the polls across the board.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25.520
From the Landes to the AlpesMaritimes, it's Cognard, Cognard, Cognard.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28.440
That's the south. It'll never be on our side.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31.840
They're fullon right wing. I know them. I go to SaintTropez.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35.200
We must focus on Western France. Vendée, Brittany, Normandy.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38.240
These are leftwing territories. There, we can make it.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41.040
We have to arrange a meeting with Andréï, working together,

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42.960
like a harmonious alliance.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44.560
Very Mitterrand in '81, you know?

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46.880
Just two men strolling along…  Yeah.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49.320
…the historic DDay landing beaches…  Ah, yeah…

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51.280
…like, "The threat's here, but we're strong."

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54.080
That's giving me goosebumps.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56.320
Totally. It's great. It's amazing. Yeah, it's good.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57.360
It's fine.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59.120
Yeah, it's cool. It's excellent.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03.760
We'd make a great team, you and I. Really, I'm telling you.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07.200
We should continue working together, ideally hand in hand.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08.960
Yeah, if you weren't a piece of shit.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11.160
Come on, now. You really have to…

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14.120
Look, Yasmine, I can see in your eyes that you respect me.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17.360
I feel like you're even, and I could be wrong, but charmed.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18.520
Because…

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20.680
I've personally gotten used to the hijab.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23.320
Honestly, it's a nice style. It reminds me of Mother Teresa.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24.880
Sexier, of course, but let's not…

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27.720
I don't mean to…

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33.440
Anyway, Guadeloupe was great. It was awesome.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35.640
People really liked the whole thing with Marion.

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37.400
We should put the final nail in the coffin.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39.840
Marion, Marion, Marion. Bigtime, bigtime.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42.240
I agree with her. We should definitely use Marion.

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44.960
You know, I think we're on the verge of securing the majority.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46.320
We can still achieve it.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49.720
Then here comes the "Eat well, for free," the "Living Together."

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52.600
Eight thousand euros minimum wage, maybe even 12,000.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55.640
School for two hours a day. I mean, it's open bar.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58.680
I'm gonna resign.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59.720
Huh? What?

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01.400
Come on, stop. Stop it. What?

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03.640
If I don't, something will get leaked to the press.

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05.320
What? Nothing. Who cares?

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06.920
It doesn't matter what gets leaked out.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09.840
That's the day in the life of a politician. Things always get out.

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12.360
Let's light a counterfire, as I said, and problem solved.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14.680
Marion slept with her bodyguard.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16.520
What?

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17.480
What?

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21.520
I can't believe it. Are you serious right now?

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22.840
You already knew?

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23.760
Huh?

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27.280
Yeah, I knew. No!

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29.960
I'm just hearing about this now. You knew already?

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33.440
Always deny. What's wrong with you? I didn't know about it.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34.960
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37.680
What? No, don't say you're sorry. No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40.600
Hey, you're selfish, man. If you resign, it'd be stupid.

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41.640
Think of your team.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43.920
Look how far we've come. We have the power, at last.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45.280
I have a driver, uh…

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47.880
Nobody cares, but anyway, we're fucking here.

63
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49.960
Think about Yasmine, the poor thing.

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51.760
What's she gonna do?  Cut it out.

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54.040
She won't get a job after this.  Stop it.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55.520
With the hijab and all that?

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56.800
Wow. All right, no.

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59.200
Listen, you shouldn't cave to blackmail, in my opinion.

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01.480
Millions of French people are counting on you.

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02.720
You have to fight.

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06.160
Do something. You can't do nothing. You can't resign.

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09.400
Listen, Stéphane, I've been with you from the beginning.

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11.840
Fool, you my cousin.

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14.720
Before the Élysée, I was there.

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16.680
We're part of the same family.

76
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18.120
When you were just a piece of shit…

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20.120
Uh… …I was there.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21.920
Just so you know, he's the president.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25.000
You may have all the flaws in the world, really, all of them.

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28.000
But what I respect about you…

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30.440
Oh! …is that you never, ever give up.

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33.240
You never give up, brother.

83
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34.440
Ouch.

84
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35.680
Careful.

85
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39.280
Sending kids on vacation. Giving food to the whole country.

86
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42.640
When others give up, you don't give up.

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44.760
Ow! Careful now, Mo.

88
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45.680
Easy.

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48.040
You okay?

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49.360
Yeah, that's right.

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52.200
Marion did sleep with that guy Aimé.

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54.600
So, sure. Yeah.

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56.880
It makes her come off as a tart.

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58.480
It's true. What? What do you mean?

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59.400
A slut. Tart.

96
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01.640
Tart means slut?  It means little slut.

97
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02.720
Little slut?

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05.040
What?

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11.160
How are you doing?

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12.680
Did you know what it meant?

101
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17.040
REPRESENT

102
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28.360
It was just like that. I don't know.

103
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32.280
Look, I don't want to know about it.

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35.080
Never mind. Okay.

105
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38.440
Actually, yeah, I do want to know. Tell me, what happened exactly?

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40.680
I don't know. I'm not sure what got into me.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44.920
I was far away, I felt lost. He…

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47.120
He was there. He listened to me, and that's it. I…

109
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51.200
I swear it didn't mean anything. It was just…

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53.000
sex.

111
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57.240
Great, amazing sex.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59.040
Awesome.

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00.920
In the morning, afternoon, and night.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03.440
Even sometimes, I'd think he was going overboard.

115
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06.760
Then again, I wasn't like, "Ugh." I was glad to.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10.720
That guy was gifted, let's not pretend I got it, thanks. Marion, I got it.

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17.120
Come on, Stéphane, I don't want you to give up.

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19.720
I don't want you to resign for my sake. That would be…

119
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23.440
With everything you've done to get here, you've worked too hard, it's…

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25.000
Okay, I hear you. You can't give up.

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27.520
But tell me, then, what should I do if the photos are leaked?

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29.960
The whole country will hate your guts. Is that what you want?

123
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36.320
I'm gonna resign.

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41.720
I love you, Marion.

125
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56.200
Stéphane, can you sign this for me?

126
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58.480
What is it?

127
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00.120
It's a reference letter.

128
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01.360
You know, I'm 60.

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04.440
I feel 58, but I don't have any degrees, so I need to plan ahead.

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07.480
"Mr. Didier Badidon is an exceptional, talented,

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09.560
and politically aware and devoted individual."

132
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13.120
"His contribution to our nation has been remarkable in many respects."

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16.520
"As president of France, I was able to observe his capacity…"

134
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20.160
I did sugarcoat it, but… I get it, it's fine. It's fine.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23.240
Good day, Mr. President.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24.240
Don't.

137
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27.320
Call me Stéphane.

138
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29.320
Good day, Stéphane.

139
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30.680
And please, uh,

140
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33.400
keep doing the good stuff you're doing in the 'hood.

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34.560
Yo, yo!

142
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35.920
Yeah, yeah!

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38.040
Yo, hoho! Yo!

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41.160
Mr. Prime Minister, what's your response

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43.160
to the rumors of resignation around the president?

146
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47.560
I'll just say that it's not my usual practice to comment on rumors,

147
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49.400
nor do I kick a man when he's down.

148
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52.840
The president asked to see me. I will see him.

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55.560
The decision is his to make.

150
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59.520
But if France calls upon me,

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02.120
I'll say it loud and clear, I won't let the country down.

152
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03.040
That's it.

153
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05.240
Do you already see yourself as president?

154
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08.200
Will you get a nose job?  Will you get implants?

155
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10.760
Not the looks.  Mr. Prime Minister, a word…

156
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11.720
Careful.

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14.000
One last question!

158
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18.760
Oh, Mr. President.

159
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23.320
Did you want to see me, sir?

160
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25.080
What's happening?

161
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26.240
I'm gonna resign.

162
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27.840
What?

163
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32.320
Mr. President, why so suddenly? What's happening? Is it a personal matter?

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34.360
Did you send the photos?

165
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36.880
The photos?

166
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40.240
Sorry, Mr. President, you're catching me off guard.

167
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42.760
Could you please clarify which photos you're referring to?

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44.760
Let me know if there's any way I can help.

169
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47.280
What's happening?

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50.080
Honestly, Andréï, I knew you were a piece of shit, but not like this.

171
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51.120
Don't bullshit me!

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52.760
A piece of shit, Mr. President?

173
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55.680
Pain is misleading you.

174
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56.800
Listen,

175
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00.960
I don't know what's on these photos, and had I seen them, sir,

176
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02.480
which is difficult to prove,

177
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06.240
I'd still want to tell you that, uh,

178
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08.960
I think you got what you fucking deserved.

179
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15.760
You know for someone like you to have gotten where he is,

180
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17.040
it's already a miracle.

181
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19.160
Did you just say someone like me? You just said that?

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21.080
I did. Oh, don't do that, please.

183
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22.800
No, don't pull that on me.

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25.520
Someone like you, indeed, a dreamer.

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27.080
For what is a dreamer?

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31.760
It's a man who gives hope. And hope is great to get elected.

187
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34.160
But not to run a country.

188
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36.560
So from now on,

189
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38.200
you see, Stéphane,

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41.160
you're going to let the grownups do their job.

191
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44.040
Go change into your PJs without saying good night,

192
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45.600
and drift off to dreamland.

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46.760
Catch my drift?

194
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51.800
Aw, he's tightening his little fists.

195
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52.800
Go ahead.

196
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54.160
You're dying to do it.

197
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55.920
You want to punch me in the face.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57.880
It's in your genes. You can't help yourself.

199
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59.440
Come on, hit me.

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02.160
That'd be very convenient for me. Beat me up.

201
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04.200
Then how do I know the photos won't get out?

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06.920
I'll keep them nice and warm.

203
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10.320
However, you will never run again in any election.

204
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13.840
Not a local one, nor a regional one. Not even for student council.

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15.160
If you do,

206
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17.480
your lovely spouse…

207
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20.800
all of France will realize how desirable she is.

208
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23.920
Just like your bodyguard.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25.600
He's so vigorous.

210
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30.600
All right, get going, because I have work to do.

211
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31.560
Go on.

212
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34.080
Thanks.

213
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37.520
Some of us are working. Now, shoo.

214
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55.040
What's going on?

215
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57.280
That longlegged fool is going to resign.

216
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58.880
Oh my God. Yes.

217
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01.000
No way.

218
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07.040
Yes! Yes!

219
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08.880
Oh!

220
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11.360
I can feel it now. I can see it, even.

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14.240
You at the Élysée, me in Matignon. We're there.

222
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16.320
We're set. We've screwed everyone.

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18.280
And you know why we did it?

224
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20.800
Do you know why we did it? Because it's our project!

225
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22.920
High five.

226
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28.520
That's over. Go wipe your nose.

227
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31.760
Come on, scram.

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33.040
Get the fuck out.

229
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40.480
You moron.

230
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44.400
It's my project.

231
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49.240
Stop it, come on. Stop it.

232
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52.520
No, you hang up first. Come on, you hang up. Stop.

233
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54.920
I swear, I'll come by to see you.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56.800
I promise, all right? Take care.

235
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57.960
Take care. You too.

236
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00.720
It's all good. We're on the news tonight.

237
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03.000
Okay, where are we on the resignation speech?

238
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06.680
Nowhere. I can't do it.  Yes, you can. Come on.

239
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09.280
No, I can't do it. I'm telling you, I really can't.

240
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11.520
It's not a resignation, it's a renouncement.

241
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14.160
So many people were counting on us. Yeah, you're not wrong.

242
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18.640
Get in touch with Planet Rap. I'll rap about quitting my job.

243
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19.560
No, no, no.

244
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21.840
I never said that. Come on.

245
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23.360
That's not what I said. Stéphane.

246
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25.680
It's never been done in the Fifth Republic.

247
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29.160
I'm gonna talk about how politicians have become corrupt, about how I'm giving up.

248
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31.280
I want it to be real, talk about the real thing.

249
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32.600
Stéphane! What is it?

250
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35.320
Hey, you need to look at this. Here.

251
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39.000
Wow.

252
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41.720
No, wait, Andréï can't be responsible for that.

253
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43.040
He isn't that stupid.

254
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44.200
Who did this?

255
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45.760
That must be Alice's work.

256
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47.120
She already stole my job.

257
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49.280
I'm going to lose my job because of that bitch.

258
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52.080
I know who it is. It has to be one of us, obviously.

259
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54.440
It's Yasmine.

260
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55.920
To keep her job. What? Me?

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58.320
Of course! You always do twisted stuff. Are you for real?

262
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00.360
Twisted stuff? You people are always sideways.

263
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03.600
What are you talking about? You don't know how to dance straight.

264
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05.920
Have you lost your mind? You dance like robots.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08.480
Who are you doing an impression of? Want me to knock you down?

266
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11.000
Knocking me down?  You're a real bloodsucker!

267
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12.400
Hold on Get lost, jerk!

268
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14.440
Why are you looking down now? Just keep it real.

269
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16.000
Please be quiet.  What?

270
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18.560
Uh, if the photos get out, it'll be a mutual termination, right?

271
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19.480
Not a resignation.

272
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21.960
I won't get any unemployment benefits if I resign.

273
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23.680
And I've got issues with my social worker.

274
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25.960
She was a dictator in a previous life.  Shut up!

275
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28.880
I'm the one who leaked the photos, all right?

276
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31.800
Now that they're out, Andréï can't blackmail you anymore.

277
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32.760
There.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37.880
Oh!

279
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40.640
Come on, that's a genius idea, sista!

280
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43.720
You're my sister, man!

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45.880
It's a genius idea, it's amazing.

282
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47.640
Okay, so let's cancel the evening news.

283
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50.320
No, no, no. We're not canceling anything at all.

284
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53.480
Tonight, we'll go together, and we're gonna be honest with the people.

285
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54.600
That's all.

286
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55.840
Are you sure?

287
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57.000
Positive.

288
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58.680
This is your comeback.

289
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00.960
We tell the truth.

290
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03.760
The whole truth.

291
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05.560
The French people will understand.

292
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07.480
The whole truth?

293
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10.240
Okay. Okay?

294
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12.200
Because I have something to say.

295
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16.560
Well, the Legion of Honor necklace,

296
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19.040
I didn't really lose it, I just can't find it. Wallah.

297
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22.840
Just so you know, tonight, the evening news means 30 million viewers.

298
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25.520
We can't just show up with excuses and a speech like,

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28.920
"Ah, my bad, I didn't mean to, but the necklace is lost somewhere."

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30.080
Come on, please. We can't.

301
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33.640
So we're going to do a short coaching session.

302
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36.920
And guess what, man? I know the perfect guy.

303
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41.000
Never. Never, do you hear?

304
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44.280
I never opened a bank account in the Cayman Islands.

305
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46.240
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

306
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48.320
It's against all I've been fighting for.

307
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51.840
So I won't let you besmirch my reputation like this.

308
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53.040
It's an ignominy.

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56.120
You see? That's the baseline.

310
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57.760
"It's ignominy."

311
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01.120
There. You see? Act offended. And feel free to make big gestures.

312
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02.240
Yeah. What?

313
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03.680
Big gestures. You do…

314
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04.880
Wah! Whoowhoo!

315
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05.880
You see?

316
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10.240
There. Now, second option, which works pretty well too.

317
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11.720
Acting surprised.

318
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14.520
"What? Me?"

319
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17.480
"Opening a bank account in the Cayman Islands?"

320
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19.160
"Come on, let's be serious."

321
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21.120
You see? Yeah, but just wanted you to…

322
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23.320
Hold on. Don't interrupt me. I'm on fire.

323
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24.720
Acting scorned.

324
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29.520
"I would never have imagined

325
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32.840
that my name would be dragged through the mud in this manner."

326
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35.240
"I come from a modest background."

327
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38.520
"My mother was a housekeeper."

328
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40.440
You were poor?

329
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42.640
No, quite the contrary. But that's irrelevant.

330
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45.640
When you don't know what to say, modest background.

331
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47.560
You can always pull that card.

332
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49.560
Plus, in your case, it's true. You come from shit.

333
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51.760
So go ahead, don't hesitate. I come from shit?

334
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53.720
Yeah, so make the most of it. All right.

335
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54.920
All right.

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58.760
"And my father was a soldier who died while serving France."

337
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00.880
What war? Doesn't matter.

338
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01.800
All right.

339
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05.640
This illiterate father of mine who only had one dream for his son.

340
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09.680
The often renewed promise of a… of a bright republican future.

341
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23.280
You've lost me here, man. I don't get it. That was the point.

342
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26.160
That's the point. You see?

343
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28.600
By the time I'm done answering, you've forgotten the question.

344
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30.240
Blah, blah, blah. You see?

345
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32.000
I can't do it. Yes, you can.

346
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33.760
No, I can't do it. Yes, you can.

347
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35.520
Go ahead. Practical case.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38.760
Come on, uh, I'll be the journalist. Okay, okay, okay.

349
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41.720
Mr. President. Yes?

350
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44.760
There are claims you're disconnected from the French people.

351
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46.560
That you're president of riffraff.

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50.720
No, stop. What are you…

353
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53.960
Come on, you can't just gesticulate at random.

354
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55.160
Sorry. Come on.

355
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56.120
I panicked a little.

356
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58.120
No need to make such big moves. Okay.

357
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01.120
Come on, answer honestly.

358
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04.360
I hear the French people.

359
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05.360
Very good.

360
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07.960
I hear their fears as well.

361
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08.920
Good.

362
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12.080
But I think there was a misunderstanding with the French people.

363
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13.800
No, no, no.

364
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15.000
What?

365
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18.720
Never tell the French people they didn't understand something.

366
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21.760
That's basic. They're very touchy, on top of being morons.

367
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23.440
All right. Wow.

368
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25.560
Plus, I really love French people.

369
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27.960
There. Like that. You got it.

370
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29.680
There.

371
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32.160
Sorry, I'm not playing at the moment. I'm being serious.

372
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35.240
Hold on. What? Okay.

373
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36.760
Wow, sounds good.

374
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39.680
Wow, all right.

375
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42.160
When's your interview?

376
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43.920
In two hours.

377
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45.080
Two hours.

378
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46.360
Yeah.

379
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48.240
This is bad.

380
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53.560
Honestly, for real, you've got one chance in 12 million to pull it off.

381
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55.880
That's cool. We have one chance.

382
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57.040
Okay, then.

383
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14.840
I really like your car. Paid for by the taxpayers.

384
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18.320
Shut the fuck up and listen to me. No, you shut the fuck up and listen.

385
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21.160
You've been shitting on me for ten years. What did you call me?

386
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24.800
A rebellious Nazi, didn't you? Mindless, unable to put on blue boots?

387
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27.400
You surely benefited from that.

388
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31.280
Every time I talk about you, you get two points in the polls.

389
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33.960
Without me, you're nothing.

390
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37.840
That was before. Now I've got the street with me.

391
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41.160
And you and Blé, we'll demolish you in the elections.

392
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43.240
You won't last two minutes as prime minister.

393
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45.280
I know that. It's nothing but troubles.

394
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48.000
That is why I'd prefer not to win the elections.

395
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50.400
I only want enough representatives to get subventions

396
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53.000
and fuck with you for five years at the Assembly.

397
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55.440
And in five years, I become president.

398
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56.920
Hmm.

399
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58.680
Of course.

400
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02.960
Don't you want to save five years?

401
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05.200
What are you talking about?

402
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09.960
Tonight, you're invited to go headtohead with the president.

403
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12.640
You're going to focus on Blé.

404
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14.880
I want you to make him fly off the handle.

405
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17.720
Tell him about, uh, the elite versus the people.

406
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19.960
I mean, add some populism. You know how to do that.

407
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20.880
Yeah.

408
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23.840
I want him to lose it on live TV.

409
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27.560
Because if he does, there will be riots.

410
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32.400
And if Blé is out, there will be new elections.

411
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33.920
Right away.

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36.840
And chances are, it'll be you and me in the second round.

413
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40.200
And then, may the best man win.

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45.200
Do you trust me?

415
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50.000
No.

416
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53.640
I wasn't gonna shake it anyway.

417
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55.280
Asshole.

418
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08.480
All over the country, discontent is on the rise.

419
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10.040
And it's turning into anger.

420
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13.000
Protests, sitins, mostly organized by the far right,

421
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14.640
and always with the same motto.

422
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17.480
"Blé, resign! Blé, bad French citizen."

423
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19.640
Get them out of Poitou!

424
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22.240
Hello, can I have an interview? Hello. Yes.

425
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25.840
I'm currently with a protester who's visibly amped up.

426
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28.920
Can you provide some insight into the symbolism behind this costume?

427
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31.280
It is Asterix? The Gaul? What is it? No, it's not Asterix.

428
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34.680
It's Vercingetorix. He kicked the Arabs out of Poitiers in 1732.

429
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37.640
So, media outlets, get your facts right. No couscous in Poitou region!

430
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41.400
This is our home! We're in France! This is our home!

431
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43.440
As you can see, just moments before

432
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45.560
the highly anticipated presidential address,

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48.200
it's evident that tension is running high among the crowd.

434
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58.840
Uh…

435
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01.320
Are we sure this is a safe place?

436
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02.840
Huh?  Is it safe?

437
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04.120
Is it safe?  Yeah.

438
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05.600
Yeah, it's safe. It's 76

439
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08.560
Uh, seven 75… 80% safe.

440
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10.600
It's not an exact science. It's gonna be fine.

441
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12.080
Everything will be okay. No worries.

442
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13.360
It'll be fine.

443
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15.960
Just trust your staff Mr. President.

444
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17.000
Wait! Don't move!

445
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18.000
Ah!

446
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21.600
Who the fuck is this? He smells like cheap wine.

447
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23.440
It's me.  Who are you?

448
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24.480
It's Didier.

449
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26.240
Yeah, it's Didier.

450
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27.440
Didier?

451
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28.920
Oh God, I hadn't recognized you.

452
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30.240
It's all right.

453
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31.480
Mr. President, it's time.

454
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34.040
Are you okay?  Something cracked, but I'm fine.

455
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35.960
It's the collarbone.  Oh!

456
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38.840
Wait, I'll… I'll help you up. I'm really sorry.

457
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40.880
Can you get up now? Because it's…

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53.200
Mr. President, Mrs. Blé, you both expressed a desire

459
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56.280
to make a statement tonight and convey the truth to the French people,

460
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58.880
by confronting this persistent rumor

461
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02.240
that says that you, Mrs. Blé, had an affair with your bodyguard.

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07.400
THE PRESIDENTIAL COUPLE FACE THE NATION

463
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10.200
Wow, he's really going all out with that, isn't he?

464
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11.560
Defamation.

465
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14.240
Knowing that I had a humble upbringing.

466
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15.800
What a disgrace.

467
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18.520
I don't see how your humble upbringing is related.

468
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19.440
Yes, it is.

469
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21.960
Here are the photos that have been leaked to the press.

470
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24.640
Oh. All right.

471
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28.440
There's speculation that they were created by artificial intelligence.

472
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30.520
So, what is the truth, Mr. President?

473
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33.280
What is your answer?

474
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35.480
Deny. Just deny, deny, deny.  So?

475
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37.080
Deny. It's false. Tell the truth.

476
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38.800
What's the plan? I can't lie.

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39.800
An answer, please.

478
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42.920
What's her deal?  The people want to know.

479
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43.880
They're real.

480
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44.840
Fuck!

481
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46.760
He's not thinking clearly.

482
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47.960
They're real.

483
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53.480
I did have an affair with Mr. Privat.

484
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55.320
Is this the man you're talking about?

485
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58.040
Oh, come on, do we really have to show a photo of him?

486
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59.680
This interview is a dumpster fire.

487
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02.000
I'm sorry for being blunt, but Mrs. Blé,

488
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04.560
could you tell me the details of your relationship with this man?

489
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06.160
So, um…

490
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09.480
I would like to express how proud I am of my husband

491
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10.800
and his courage

492
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14.400
because I hear people who say things like,

493
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16.880
"Oh, Stéphane Blé was shot in the testicles."

494
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18.600
"He only has one." What's wrong with her?

495
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19.880
"He's not a man." You know?

496
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22.440
Nobody is saying that.  Can we stop with the clichés?

497
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23.760
Smile. Show teeth.

498
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25.360
What does it mean to be a man?

499
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27.560
We need to break down our patterns of thinking.

500
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30.800
He's a man. A person of honor, sincere.

501
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32.800
Kind Black man. Generous…

502
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36.320
Stéphane is all those things, all right? That's why I love him.

503
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41.200
So is it really that important to know if he's capable of giving an orgasm,

504
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43.240
or whether he even knows what it is?

505
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44.280
I know what it is.

506
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46.400
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

507
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47.480
French people are like me.

508
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50.400
They've chosen him for what is in his mind, in his heart,

509
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51.840
but not his pants or wherever.

510
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54.120
What the…  What's important isn't us.

511
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55.640
It's France. I'm good down there.

512
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57.400
Of course. Now smile.

513
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59.960
Come on. I'm good. You know it very well. You've forgotten.

514
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02.600
It's beside the point. You shouldn't humiliate people on TV.

515
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04.400
We haven't been sleeping together.

516
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06.040
I've got the goods.  Calm down.

517
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08.200
I am calm, I'm calm, but don't get me started on this.

518
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11.880
And you have to cut this off in the final edit, because I don't

519
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14.320
That's not possible, Mr. President. We are live.

520
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16.880
After the break, we'll talk about the president's impotence

521
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17.880
with the French people.

522
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20.240
Stay tuned. But I'm not impotent, actually.

523
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21.200
Give that a rest.

524
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24.360
I was talking about your political impotence, Mr. President.

525
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26.600
See you after the break. You have to be explicit.

526
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30.160
Cut. Back on air in three minutes.

527
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31.160
Great.

528
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35.880
Good. Very good.  You're killing it.

529
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37.240
Yeah. You nailed it.

530
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38.680
It's a disaster. Not at all.

531
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40.640
The social media reaction has been mostly good.

532
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42.880
Totally. #HeresMyCuckold."

533
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45.520
Oh, uh, #AllImpotent." I mean, it's great. It's amazing.

534
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47.240
Amazi Hey, ma'am.

535
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49.400
On the other hand, trash journalism isn't very classy.

536
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50.440
Whatever. He's crazy.

537
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52.080
Showing nudes? I mean, come on.

538
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53.960
Have you checked the ratings yet?

539
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55.080
Are you okay?

540
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56.360
Yeah, I'm okay.

541
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58.600
I just hope this doesn't drag on forever.

542
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01.280
The longer it lasts, the more sorry they'll feel.

543
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04.640
Don't put him down like that.  What? Don't be ridiculous.

544
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12.720
Mr. President, your taking office has generated an immense sense of hope,

545
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14.800
but one month in, it's quite a disappointment.

546
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17.040
Not true.  The "Eat well, for free"

547
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18.640
is just starting in Guadeloupe.

548
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22.360
The "Living Together" measure is testing in a district of Paris,

549
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24.200
but it isn't impressive so far.

550
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26.960
Well, I haven't been in office for long, so it's not surprising.

551
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30.240
That's for sure, but we sense the anger is growing,

552
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32.960
and you're expected to lose at the legislative elections.

553
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34.880
So, Mr. President, what happened?

554
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36.680
Have you experienced a setback?

555
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39.160
Or is it the French people who misunderstood you?

556
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42.760
No, uh, French people understood.

557
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45.920
I struggled to articulate my thoughts. But I'll keep trying to be convincing.

558
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47.840
Good.  You have a chance tonight.

559
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51.120
There is one French citizen who isn't convinced by your results.

560
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54.120
He's here. Let's welcome him. Fred Cognard.

561
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56.120
What does she mean? What the hell? No…

562
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59.080
Pardon me. Sorry, excuse me. Let me go, please. Let me go.

563
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00.480
Please. Come on, move.

564
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04.400
Mrs. Portolano.

565
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06.080
Nagadef.

566
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08.120
What? Uh…

567
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09.520
Nagadef?

568
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11.600
It means "good evening" in Wolof.

569
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13.720
I thought you were proud of your origins, Mr. Blé.

570
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15.960
My origins? I'm from the Ivory Coast, not Senegal.

571
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17.440
You're Ivorian?  Yes.

572
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19.000
Not French? That's not what I said.

573
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21.800
I wouldn't mind seeing a birth certificate,

574
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23.880
if they make them in the country where you come from.

575
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24.880
Please. Just kidding.

576
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27.400
What? He annoys me.  I'm just kidding.

577
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28.960
That was shady, even from you.

578
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31.400
Yes, but I was joking. Aren't we allowed to joke anymore?

579
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35.040
Your question, Mr. Cognard? My question is simple, Mrs. Portolano.

580
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38.040
Mr. Blé, sorry to tell you that since you took office,

581
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40.400
it's been failure after failure.

582
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44.200
Right, France has never been this divided. Unemployment is skyrocketing.

583
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46.440
Women wearing hijabs proliferate.

584
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48.920
Delinquency, let's not even mention it.

585
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52.240
Educators, who actually are predominantly excons…

586
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54.240
I didn't think it'd come to this.

587
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56.480
It's time to bring out the big guns.  What?

588
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58.800
Don't worry about it. Sorry, out of my way.

589
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00.760
Mr. Cognard, your question, please.

590
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02.360
I'm getting there. Calm down.

591
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04.000
I am calm. It's all going to be fine.

592
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06.000
Pardon?  No need to get hysterical.

593
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08.600
Excuse me? Must be the five bad day of the month.

594
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12.360
Mr. Cognard, stop. My question, Mrs. Portolano,

595
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13.680
is very simple.

596
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14.760
Yes?

597
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17.080
What did France do to you, Mr. Blé?

598
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19.400
To me?  Why do you hate it so much?

599
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21.440
Why don't you hear these millions of voices

600
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23.520
of heartfelt screams from the French people

601
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25.680
who are right there, in front of your palace,

602
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28.360
screaming, "Get out, you piece of shit!"

603
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29.960
Mr. Cognard, please.

604
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33.600
I'm sorry, but I'm only repeating what I hear every day, Mrs. Portolano,

605
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37.600
Why is it that you don't have any respect for the people who elected you, Mr. Blé?

606
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40.240
When do you plan on stepping down for good?

607
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42.080
For good…

608
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45.520
Fuck that. Let me go. Hands off.

609
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48.360
Sorry, let me through. It'll be quick.

610
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51.040
Sorry, sorry to interrupt. Hold on, hold on.

611
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52.960
What are you doing? Hold on, Mrs. Puerto Rico.

612
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56.560
I just have one small thing. Other French people are dissatisfied.

613
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59.000
Actually, I brought one of them with me, so to speak.

614
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00.960
Maybe you'll recognize her. Who's that?

615
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03.680
Who is it? This man was charged with a crime involving animals.

616
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05.520
Let me remind you, animals. Bestiality.

617
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08.160
I can't let you say that. That's defamation.

618
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11.840
Plus, it wasn't even that breed. Okay, so now "breeds" matter.

619
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13.160
Of course. They're dogs.

620
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14.680
All right, okay, I mean…

621
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16.960
My God, he always tries to beat around the bush.

622
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18.800
Do you realize that this poor little creature

623
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21.320
which he, excuse my French, fucked

624
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23.160
and then left behind like it was nothing.

625
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26.400
It was found in a children's park 200 yards from his residence.

626
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28.880
It was all ripped apart, no more teeth. What are you doing?

627
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29.840
Covered in blood.

628
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32.640
How can you do something like that to a poor little creature?

629
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34.880
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.  How was it?

630
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36.680
Sir, it's disgraceful. Please, that's enough.

631
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39.480
It's a freak show. You are making a fool of yourself.

632
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41.680
Give her some biscuits? How does that work?

633
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43.480
How do you seduce it? Is there an app?

634
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45.320
You're embarrassing me.  I'm just…

635
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47.840
You're embarrassing me. Leave the set.

636
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49.280
That's all I had to say.

637
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52.120
Some of us are dissatisfied.

638
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54.200
I… That was ridiculous.

639
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56.400
I'm really sorry. That wasn't planned at all.

640
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58.480
You're stupid. What the fuck, man?

641
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00.680
What the heck was that? It was the right move.

642
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02.760
It's true, he was charged with bestiality.

643
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05.200
He can't deny it. That's defamation. Plus, I love animals.

644
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07.880
Actually, regarding animals, when I join the government

645
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11.360
About that, let's talk about this. You're the new prime minister.

646
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12.720
Let's do it, man. What?

647
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14.240
Hmm?

648
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16.440
If you can do better, I'll appoint you prime minister.

649
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17.560
Well… Hold on.

650
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19.160
It's a prank. Wait a second.

651
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22.120
That's a big announcement you're making, Mr. President.

652
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24.120
Yes. Mr. Cognard, do you accept the role?

653
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27.160
I mean, come on. It's not… It's absurd.  Come on!

654
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29.080
Prime minister, it's…

655
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33.080
President. I like president better. That's much better, in fact.

656
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35.600
Let me tell you, Cognard. President is a terrible job.

657
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38.080
For real, it's not that great. Prime minister is more concrete.

658
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40.160
You can change the French people's lives.

659
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41.680
You could do a better job?

660
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43.640
Go ahead. I'll appoint you prime minister.

661
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44.640
Go ahead.

662
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46.040
Mr. Cognard?

663
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48.120
Listen, this is ridiculous.

664
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52.800
I can't believe it. Is he chickening out?

665
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53.920
Unbelievable.

666
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57.280
What the hell is Fred doing? Why doesn't he accept?

667
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59.120
What the hell is he up to?

668
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02.600
It's ridiculous, we should probably get back to a topic that…

669
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03.920
that interests French people,

670
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05.680
such as halal meat in schools, for example.

671
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08.880
This topic is very important. Don't change the subject, okay?

672
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10.040
Don't change the subject.

673
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12.880
I've just offered you to be the prime minister in my government.

674
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14.480
Do you want it, yes or no?

675
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18.440
We're waiting on you.

676
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21.360
He's chickening out.  What's going on?

677
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22.800
No? Are you sure?

678
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25.880
All right. French people will see that you're all talk, no action.

679
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27.720
Hopefully, I'll see you at the next elections.

680
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30.520
Our program is coming to an end.

681
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33.040
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Cognard.

682
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35.640
What the hell? He chickened out.

683
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37.800
Even he lets us down.

684
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40.040
We gotta do something. They're all corrupt.

685
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41.600
They're all the same.

686
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43.000
Let's get out of here.

687
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45.600
Come on. We have to change shit on our own.

688
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47.000
We'll do it ourselves.

689
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48.520
We have to do something.

690
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51.640
If the politicians let us down, there's only one solution left.

691
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54.960
It's death!

692
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58.720
Come on!

693
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08.760
Excuse me, just one minute.

694
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09.880
Before I wrap things up,

695
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12.800
