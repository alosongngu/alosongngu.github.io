00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08.560
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11.280
Yo, we've been waiting here for an hour. What's going on?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13.040
Please wait your turn, sir.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16.880
What do you think they'll do for you? They follow orders.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19.280
To those guys, we're just Negroes.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20.680
No, Mo, come on.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23.480
Hello, Commissioner Feuillet, sir. How can I help you, Mr. Blé?

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25.440
You could find whoever set fire to my HQ.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27.560
That would be nice. We're on it, so don't obsess.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29.680
Isn't the city covered in video surveillance?

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31.960
There's a camera by your HQ, but it wasn't working.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33.440
Tech issues happen.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36.040
Well, then, we'll stay in touch. Good day.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38.560
I ain't all on my own, you know. It doesn't end here.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40.320
Calm down. I got an army supporting me.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42.280
Sure. Sure. Right, Mo?

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44.360
Mo! Don't fuck around!

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47.400
Hmm? Man, what the fuck's keeping you, huh?

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50.480
What now, huh? What? Oh, the video surveillance.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51.840
What video surveillance?

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55.640
I installed GoPros all over HQ. Are you an idiot?

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57.760
And you just tellin' me?

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00.200
Well, you never asked me. What the fuck?

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02.480
Did you ask me? You didn't, so Come on, explain.

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03.760
You didn't ask me!

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07.640
So, there, you choose the location, and choose the day right there.

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10.320
Entrance, open space, uh, the toilets, all that.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13.600
You put a camera in the toilets?

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15.720
Really, man?

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17.840
Hmm? You put a camera in the toilets?

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21.720
Threats may come unexpectedly.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24.320
And by the way, Didier is a pig. The plunger's been used

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26.680
I really don't give a fuck about how Didier shits.

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29.520
Bring up Friday at nine o'clock. Right now, hurry.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32.160
Shit.  You haven't seen them though.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33.560
Forget it. They clog the toilet.

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35.640
I don't care, Mo! Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42.200
Hang on. Aren't those your cousin's guys?

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44.480
Fuck.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47.920
Well, he's a bitch, huh?

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56.680
How are you, Stéphane? I'm fine.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58.400
What happened to your HQ is crazy.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00.160
Right?  People are sick.

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01.760
Nuts.  How's Auntie?

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03.160
Good.  See you.

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05.160
Yeah, thank you.

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07.040
He can't come in. You see?

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10.400
Why'd you have your boys do that? Hey, keep it down, dude. Come on.

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11.600
Djibril is resting.

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13.920
Listen Is this how you come into my house now?

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16.000
Why'd you send your boys to set fire to my HQ?

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18.360
What boys? What d'you mean? That's not Djokovic there?

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22.360
Man, I recognize the scooter. I recognize the jersey.

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25.520
It was just a Molotov, okay? Not some grenade. I wouldn't burn anyone.

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27.800
I'm not gonna burn Auntie. Calm down. Calm down.

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30.000
Did Andréï mess with your head or something?

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32.800
What has he promised you? You could run your business? That's it?

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34.440
You're better than that!

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36.240
You're better than that! Hey, hey, hey.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38.400
Are you about to start preaching at me?

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41.600
I have my security company, but without Andréï backing me, it's sunk.

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42.800
Andréï doesn't give a shit.

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45.480
Oh, and you do? You care about me? It's all bullshit.

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48.600
Did you think of me when you started your campaign?

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51.080
No. You blocked me out, same as always.

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54.520
You brought in that buffoon Maurice, a bumbling idiot and compulsive crook.

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56.480
It's not like that! Just be quiet!

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58.640
Thought you didn't care about politics.

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01.000
Like he spends his entire day watching CSPAN.

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12.560
I didn't steal from you, Dés. All right?

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15.640
The bag got lost! It's my fault!

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17.360
How else can I say it, bro?

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19.880
I'm not a criminal! I believe you.

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21.520
Do I look like a thief? Huh?

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23.840
Do I look like a thief, man? Huh?

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25.920
I said, do I look like a thief or what? No.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26.840
Fuck no!

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28.920
Let's go.

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30.600
Hey, let's go.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33.720
Yeah, but I… I was robbed, bro. We were at the post office

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40.080
Hey, Etienne.

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41.120
SOLUTIONS FROM BELOW

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43.720
No, it's going great. We're at seven percent.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46.560
I guess we stole five percent of Andréï's votes.

85
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48.440
Oh, he's enraged.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51.000
Totally gutted. He's gotta be just, uh…

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53.000
Oh, shit.

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55.320
Oh, fuck.

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58.320
I'll call you back. Call you back. Oh, no, no, no.

90
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03.760
I'm busy right now. Hmm. An interview, I imagine, right?

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06.320
For the newspaper Le Monde?

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07.560
A nice article.

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10.840
"The kingmaker, William Crozon!"

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14.040
That would've been a nice title. But, no.

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16.640
It's "William Crozon, the buffoon."

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18.080
That's how it is.

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21.400
Because it was me… …who invited you.

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24.920
Just look how easily I trapped you. I'm your interview.

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27.800
All right. Can the two of us talk, please?

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31.880
I wanted to talk with you, that's all. Get off your high horse, if you please.

101
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34.920
I won't talk, man. Well, I have a lot to say to you.

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38.440
Tell me, who was on the phone just now? Etienne Durandeau?

103
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39.840
He promised you what? Hmm?

104
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41.240
No, not Matignon.

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44.720
Now you're just blathering. This is fantasy. You're delirious.

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46.320
There's nothing, dude.

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47.720
Don't take me for a fool.

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51.520
You think I'm unaware your sponsors are all from the right wing, huh?

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54.200
Eighty percent are from the right. So what? So what?

110
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56.320
Shut up, please. Listen to me.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57.840
See that?

112
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00.040
The guy with "solutions from below," take him down.

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02.960
That's impossible. We are making such great progress.

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05.480
He's a hit. Then you break his pace.

115
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08.240
Fat chance. Get him out of his comfort zone.

116
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11.920
He's fine meeting folks who wear turbans and babouches and big harem pants.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15.000
Stéphane and his Black guys. Take him to Corrèze.

118
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17.480
To Corrèze? Yes, Corrèze!

119
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18.840
To Corrèze? Pfft.

120
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21.360
It'll do him good to see the real France.

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25.720
You get it? The real France, from below. He left and he'll return.

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27.720
If I take him to Corrèze… Mmhmm?

123
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29.000
…he'll get torn apart.

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30.840
Well, that's the hope, huh?

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34.080
Listen, you do this for me,

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37.280
there may be a small spot in my campaign for you.

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41.600
Now you think it over, right? But not too long. You might hurt yourself.

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43.600
And also, know if you don't cooperate,

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47.480
I'll call the press and tell them all about your little plot with Durandeau.

130
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49.920
I'm sure that they'll absolutely love it.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53.480
All right. I'll leave this to you. You know what the Bété say, right?

132
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56.640
Rourou, laviola, loucouloucou! Shit. Damn it.

133
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01.160
Okay, welcome to Corrèze, guys.

134
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03.520
So, most importantly, don't change a thing, okay?

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05.480
We keep it gangsta. We keep it Black.

136
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12.120
Is that Creole?  Of course it's Creole.

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22.560
Yasmine? Would you mind taking off your…

138
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25.000
I just feel like it's causing some tension here.

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27.800
Yeah, sure, that's no problem, once you quit being Black.

140
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28.800
Oh.

141
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32.440
Well, I'm sorry, but no one forced me to be Black, okay?

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33.680
Are you serious?

143
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36.520
Hang on. He You better not mean that.

144
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38.040
Calm down. There are cameras.

145
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40.120
Calm down. Yeah, well, calm yourself.

146
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43.520
You know, Yasmine, you are completely right.

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44.680
Don't disown yourself.

148
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47.120
Have you tried the versions with the little grids here?

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48.720
It's a bit like the troopers in…

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51.640
With Darth Vader. They're like…

151
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53.920
It makes a noise too, right? It's electrified?

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56.280
No, but did you guys work this out together or what?

153
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57.320
Hey, I'm warning you.

154
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00.200
If anyone even looks suspicious, I'm on it, stat. Okay?

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02.600
Because hillbillies living in the ass end of nowhere,

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04.400
you know they're just bad news.

157
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05.560
I brought tear gas. Whoa.

158
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06.640
Calm down. No, I'm calm.

159
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09.240
I brought gas. If anyone moves… Pssh! Zzz!

160
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11.760
I'm dressed, like a salad. That's not what we wanted though.

161
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14.120
Zzz! See?  Uh, Mr. Blé?

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15.640
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

163
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17.920
Happy you're here. Welcome. Me too. Glad to be here.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20.680
Hello, Gégé! How are you? Ah, just fine. You?

165
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23.200
Great. And Lucette? Lucette, she's dead.

166
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25.680
She was run over on the county highway.

167
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26.920
Shit. You forgot?

168
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29.480
Anyway, we had a lovely drive here.

169
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30.840
Yeah?  Yeah, we did.

170
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33.920
It was very pretty. That's fabulous. Was it easy to find?

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36.240
Oh, yeah. There's really not much traffic out here.

172
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37.400
Ah.

173
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40.840
CITY HALL

174
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45.280
This is Super 300 with silk threads. Berlusconi wore only this.

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47.760
It doesn't seem right.

176
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49.520
I don't feel like me. That's the idea.

177
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56.680
Everybody…

178
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58.200
…let's leave the candidate, please.

179
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07.760
I told you not to come without warning me first.

180
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08.920
What is it?

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12.080
Stéphane showed up at my place with some video surveillance.

182
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14.320
He knows it was my boys. He knows I'm the one who did it.

183
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16.000
It's been handled already.

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18.800
I know people in Domestic Affairs. There won't be an investigation.

185
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21.120
So, don't panic. We're taking care of that idiot.

186
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23.200
By tonight, he'll be toast.

187
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25.280
He won't last for two minutes with those hillbillies.

188
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26.800
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

189
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29.520
They said they finished their contract at the… at the prefecture.

190
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30.840
So bring my guys on board.

191
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32.440
Listen.

192
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35.880
It's a bit more complicated. You see, it's not possible that way.

193
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36.880
I'll ponder that. Ah.

194
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40.080
Now, please Ah, well, you can make it happen.

195
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42.360
Don't make me spill everything I have on you.

196
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46.400
Also, do something, uh, about daycare.

197
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47.400
What?

198
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50.240
There are strikes all the time. Oh, yeah. All right.

199
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53.520
All right, pal. Thank you.  Yeah.

200
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01.040
My mother raised me by herself, alone. She had trouble making ends meet.

201
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02.320
Let me tell you one thing.

202
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04.640
Even with all the best intentions in the world,

203
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06.120
when you feel that hunger,

204
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08.200
it's bound to end up being a hard day.

205
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11.720
If I'm elected president, what I propose…

206
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15.680
is that everyone can choose to make meals with local produce

207
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18.200
that's from organic farmers, and do it for free.

208
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21.520
With farmers being paid a fair price.

209
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23.920
Hey, but, uh, Stéphane, the speech got changed, Stéphane.

210
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30.440
Basically, if I'm elected, what I propose is a winwin solution

211
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33.800
for people in the cities and people in the countryside.

212
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35.080
Vote Blé. Thank you.

213
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37.120
Yes! Yes!

214
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41.560
We believe in you! Woo!

215
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43.440
Why didn't you read my speech?

216
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45.800
I wrote you a great speech for this.

217
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49.200
Okay, yeah, but a poem by Aimé Césaire on Négritude here

218
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50.560
didn't seem right at all.

219
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51.840
He's universal, Aimé Césaire.

220
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54.000
It's universal when you're one of us. So universal.

221
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56.760
You really think around here Are you kidding me? Well, then…

222
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00.240
Well, should we take photos, Mr. Mayor? All right. Uh…

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03.080
The hijab is important there. CloseClose in on the hijab.

224
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05.520
Mmhmm. Yeah. It's overexposed, you can't make out the…

225
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09.040
Enhance the Black people. And make sure we can see the hijab.

226
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10.880
Perfect. Um.

227
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12.680
Stéphane, raise up a fist.

228
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16.200
No, the photo's bridging the community. I think it represents your stance.

229
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18.360
It'd be cool to see the fist. Yeah, but no.

230
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19.320
Okay, Mo…

231
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20.640
Malcolm X.

232
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22.600
There. Great. No, no. Mo, no.

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24.120
Yes, it's great. No, no.

234
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26.040
It's great. Stéphane! No, no, no.

235
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28.880
Okay, we'll take it as is. Go ahead. Yeah.

236
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35.680
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

237
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38.520
On the ride in, we noticed that it's as bad as the ghetto here.

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40.960
It's all abandonedlooking. Ah, yes, yes.

239
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43.840
Post office closed a year ago. The last baker left two months ago.

240
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46.240
Yeah, yes, it's completely neglected, yes.

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49.800
Since the slums steal money now, there's nothing for the French.

242
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51.520
I don't get it.

243
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53.880
Wait, in the projects, we're just as French as you are.

244
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54.800
Oh, really?

245
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58.200
With you guys, it's not "made in France," it's "Mohammed in France."

246
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00.440
Hey, what you just say? Hey, what you talking 'bout?

247
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02.080
No, relax.  Don't calm down.

248
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04.080
Sorry, Stéphane, you should Yes, calm down.

249
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05.840
Mo? That's great. It's funny.

250
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08.880
No, it's not funny. I'm confused. Did I say something wrong?

251
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10.760
Well, I don't think anything he said is funny.

252
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13.400
Mathieu, please, go take a walk.

253
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15.240
Now, please. Maréchal, heel.

254
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17.400
He better walk his doggie.

255
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20.600
Yeah, take a walk.  There. It's not his fault.

256
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21.680
My nephew, he…

257
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25.080
His factory collapsed, and now he's unemployed, divorced

258
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26.320
Hey!

259
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28.600
That's the finish of Mass, I do believe.  Mm.

260
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30.840
You should know that Stéphane is very Christian.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33.840
And it would be nice for him to chat a little with the parishioners.

262
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36.760
Mm, no, but thanks anyway. It's really so perfect, I know. Oh, yes.

263
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39.880
But I haven't been to Mass in years. Seems now is your chance to return.

264
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42.400
Simone would love it. I promise. No.

265
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44.760
Yes, Stéphane is very into religion.

266
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47.480
The idea would be to plunder the budget of the army,

267
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50.280
for constructing, uh, churches and, uh, and mosques.

268
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51.880
Ah, well, look. The parishioners.

269
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53.520
Hello, Mr. Blé. Hello.

270
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56.160
We all know that your family is very religious.

271
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57.800
We were in New York recently.

272
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59.880
We were lucky enough to attend a Mass in Harlem.

273
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02.240
Wow.  It was, uh…

274
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03.560
Amazing.  Intense.

275
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05.800
We wanted to ask if you might sing a little, uh…

276
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07.200
some gospel here.

277
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09.160
Yes, Mr. Blé. Uh, well, no.

278
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10.400
Well, go on. Why not?

279
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11.640
Uh, no. But why not?

280
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15.160
Giscard, uh, played the accordion. Why don't you sing, huh?

281
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18.480
This is such a great idea. II believe it's a great idea.

282
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20.680
Oh, wonderful! He really has an amazing voice, truly.

283
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24.200
Let's go on the steps. That's superb. Then everyone can see. Yes, Stéphane, go.

284
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25.520
What? I can't sing.

285
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27.160
Yes, he sings. What are you doing?

286
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29.760
You can't sing gospel It's perfect. He sings very well.

287
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31.160
Sing. Sing, sing!

288
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32.080
He'll sing.

289
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35.400
Come on, Mr. Blé. Like New York.  Go ahead. Come on.

290
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37.920
You can't sing in front of everybody. Stop. Of course he can.

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39.160
Watch. Go on. Nah, man.

292
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43.040
Hello, Father.

293
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45.520

No, what don't you understand? I asked you to bring him down a peg.

Now, he's on every single channel, blessing the crowd!

Listen You said you'd steal leftwing votes.

Well You The old church crowd are mine, William.

329
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19.440
You're not doing what we discussed. I got this. What else can I say?

330
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20.720
Call you back.

331
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22.680
Pain in the ass.

332
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24.960
Oh, thank you. That's cool, that's cool.

333
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27.480
Ah, what a lovely family. Thank you.

334
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28.960
Sorry. Excuse me. You're welcome.

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30.560
Stéphane, we should go, okay?

336
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33.000
This is good. This was an awesome idea, coming here.

337
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35.560
It was great. All right. Let's go. Yeah, it's going great.

338
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38.440
You wanna know our lives, how things happen here, yeah?

339
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40.520
Uh, yeah! Yeah? Great. Come with me now.

340
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42.800
What's happening?  An issue with a farmer.

341
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44.080
So how's it going?

342
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47.000
It's cool. We're chillin'. It's the countryside, you know.

343
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49.920
You're okay? They welcomed you?  They're a little weird, but…

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52.280
Hang on. Do you mind if we talk later? I can't talk now.

345
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54.640
Are those shots?

346
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57.320
Uh, not exactly. I'll tell you later. Bye, dear.

347
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01.840
Come any closer, I'll blow my head off!

348
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03.880
Who's that?

349
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06.680
Hervé. He's really not a bad guy. He's just unlucky.

350
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08.760
They're seizing his farm, and he's drowning in debt.

351
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10.560
And his wife split with the rep from Monsanto

352
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11.880
who was selling him GMOs.

353
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14.800
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We saw your constituents.

354
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16.520
It was great. Stéphane, let's bounce. No.

355
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18.880
Let's go, team.  I won't let him down!

356
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20.640
Suicide is a real problem. Oh, shit.

357
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23.680
Mo and I have lost friends that way. We had no idea.

358
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24.920
Who, Vegeta?

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yeah. Yeah, but he was a fool, man.

360
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29.520
May he rest in peace. It wasn't his fault. Peace.

361
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31.360
I won't let him down. We're not gonna die.

362
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32.440
I won't let him down.

363
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33.640
Hervé! Stop. Stop.

364
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36.240
What are you doing? No, no, no. My name is Stéphane Blé!

365
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38.120
A candidate running for president. All right?

366
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40.720
You're gonna be fine.

367
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42.840
Go to hell! For fuck's sake, he's armed!

368
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46.640
Let's go now! Let's get out! Stéphane, are you crazy? Think of Marion!

369
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48.200
Stéphane, hang on. Don't.

370
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50.040
Please, stop. Please, Stéphane!

371
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51.680
Shit. No, no, no. Hervé!

372
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55.440
You really are stupid. I just wanna chat! Just chat, okay?

373
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57.800
You're not armed? No!

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00.640
Take off your coat!

375
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02.040
And your balaclava!

376
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05.640
I'm not wearing one, Hervé.

377
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08.000
Okay, sorry.

378
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10.360
Stéphane, stop. Wait, wait.

379
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12.840
Don't, please. You can't, man. This guy's the nervous type.

380
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14.760
Yeah, looks like it. Here. Have this.

381
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16.120
Here. Bring this baton.

382
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17.800
It could protect you.

383
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20.200
But he'll clearly see I've got a baton.

384
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22.840
No, no, no. It goes in your pocket. It's small.

385
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23.960
Hurry. He'll see it.

386
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25.600
No, he won't.

387
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27.600
Now, look. Invisible. Let's go, let's go.

388
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30.720
Let's go, Stéphane. We have a campaign. We have a campaign. Oh, fuck.

389
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33.000
Hervé…

390
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34.680
I'm approaching.

391
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37.440
God, no!  Stéphane!

392
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39.040
Sorry! That went off by itself!

393
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41.800
What the actual fuck, man? It'll be okay.

394
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46.040
Oh, wow! You're lucky. You're really wellendowed!

395
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48.840
It's true what they say.

396
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51.520
If I had one like that, my wife wouldn't have left me!

397
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54.080
Hervé, you're droppin' a lot of details here.

398
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56.240
I just wanna know, what's the problem?

399
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59.160
My problem is guys like you!

400
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01.920
I know you guys! All talk, no action!

401
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04.120
What do you want? You just showing off?

402
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06.160
You and your big dick? Whoa.

403
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08.520
You don't think I can see the cameras?

404
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11.080
Cut! Come on, come on!

405
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12.040
Come on!

406
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15.640
Hervé, it's just me and you, my guy.

407
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18.600
I'll come to you.  No! No!

408
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20.280
Hervé!

409
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22.480
What?  I'm comin' over.

410
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25.560
You and me, good vibes only. Okay?

411
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28.440
Like hiphop parties.  I don't talk American!

412
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30.240
Sorry, my bad.

413
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35.160
You know, Hervé, I've been around the block, my man.

414
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38.400
And I traveled so I could help kids in Mexico.

415
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39.960
I know a little Spanish.

416
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42.680
Conchita de la luz.

417
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44.800
Hable donde agua.

418
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46.600
That's how you say…

419
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51.040
"I'm coming in peace. I guarantee it."

420
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52.760
Come on, open the door.

421
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55.720
Your Spanish is good. You seem really nice. Come on in.

422
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57.520
Oh, fuck. He went inside. He went inside.

423
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59.680
William. William!  Fuck.

424
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02.200
Hey, if he takes a bullet…

425
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04.000
do I still get paid?

426
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06.680
What are you We're unpaid volunteers. Mo, no one's paid.

427
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07.960
What?  Nobody's paid.

428
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10.160
I'm not paid?  No. Nobody's paid.

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11.840
I don't accept this, Hervé.

430
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13.880
This all looks great, man. Why turn to suicide?

431
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16.400
Well…

432
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18.960
Hey, you even have a pig. A sheep, man.

433
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20.320
Oh. That's Britney.

434
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22.600
She's my favorite, but she's sick and gonna die.

435
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25.640
And when that happens, well, just emptiness, right?

436
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30.520
Yes, but life is still beautiful. Isn't it? Right?

437
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33.360
Well, my parents have passed, my wife left me as well.

438
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34.960
I had to mortgage my place here.

439
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39.480
No, but, you know the saying. "As long as you're healthy…"

440
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41.360
I'm sick. Autoimmune.

441
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44.240
Can't have kids. Can't get hard anymore.

442
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48.560
You and me are the same.

443
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51.040
Look, I'm broke, and my mother's naggin' all day.

444
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52.600
Now my wife and I can't get pregnant.

445
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54.480
So, I know, huh? Even with your…

446
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59.440
Yeah, even with my… Well, I have no reason to mislead you.

447
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02.000
I see desperate people all day long.

448
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05.000
Except that mine are teens. They think they're done for.

449
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07.840
And I'm fighting for my kids. For you too, truthfully.

450
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13.200
You seem too dumb to be a liar. What's your drink?

451
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15.960
Oh, uh…  I'm not sure.

452
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18.240
Uh, pear juice, please? Yeah?

453
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19.200
Yeah. Pear booze?

454
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20.520
No, juice. Yeah, a shot.

455
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22.880
Oh, from a bottle, right?

456
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25.120
You got it. Here.

457
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29.280
Uh, what's going on now?

458
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32.080
Nothing's happening. There's nothing happening.

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36.360
I can go down the chimney.

460
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38.120
Uh, no.

461
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40.480
Why not? What chimney?

462
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42.280
Well, that one over there.

463
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44.080
Why not? Go. Marion's calling me, guys.

464
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46.280
Marion's calling me. What should I say? Uh, nothing.

465
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48.320
Things are quiet. Everything's fine.

466
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50.240
Yeah, Lamine? Yeah, Marion.

467
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53.480
Uh, it'sit's all fine. The sun is out.

468
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55.960
Just here with William, uh, Mo, Yasmine, uh…

469
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58.120
Yeah, we're all We're here, Marion. Hello.

470
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00.080
Don't fuck with me! I can see you!

471
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02.640
What do you mean you can see me? You see me now?

472
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04.840
BLÉ ENTERS THE HOME OF ARMED MADMAN

473
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07.840
Well, in fact, uh, SStéphane, he was talking with that guy.

474
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10.480
He just walked right in, and that's as much as we know right now.

475
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12.880
But don't worry. Of course I'm worried!

476
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14.800
Those guys are gonna launch an attack, for sure.

477
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17.680
Hey, no. They won't attack. No one's attacking. There's no attack.

478
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20.120
Okay, Marion, take care. Uh, I'll keep you posted.

479
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24.080
Hervé, what are you doing? Quit screwing around!

480
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25.400
Don't be a fucking idiot!

481
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27.280
Stéphane, you seem nice, but I have to end it.

482
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29.800
Quit it! You can't be serious!

483
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30.800
Oh, shit.

484
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35.960
What's happening?

485
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38.760
She's giving birth. But you said she was about to die.

486
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40.920
I don't know. The vet told me that she was sterile.

487
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43.080
Well, it makes sense why you lost it all.

488
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46.000
You're a bit of an idiot, huh, Hervé?

489
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47.760
Okay.

490
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50.520
What are you doing?

491
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53.120
What are you doing? Put this on.

492
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54.880
What? Well, you'll learn.

493
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56.920
Just help me. You'll become a dad too.

494
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59.280
Okay. Let's go.

495
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02.200
All right.

496
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03.440
All right. Oh.

497
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05.320
Hey. Okay, push, baby. Push. Oh.

498
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07.120
Push, baby, push!

499
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09.600
Oh, I touched its vag.  That's good.

500
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10.800
That's good.

501
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12.600
Ugh!  You're doing good, man.

502
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14.440
Come out with your hands on your head!

503
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16.280
We're launching an attack!

504
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19.160
Whoa. Hey, guys, hang on! Something's going on in here!

505
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21.360
Just stay focused.

506
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23.840
All right, here we go. All right, push!

507
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26.680
Push, baby! It's beautiful! This birth, Stéphane, it's beautiful!

508
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28.080
Oh, no.

509
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29.880
Yes, it is, Stéphane.  No.

510
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31.800
It's fucking beautiful! It's beautiful!

511
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32.800
There.

512
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34.640
Oh, my God. I touched a sheep's

513
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36.120
That's good.

514
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38.400
Come on, come on.

515
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42.480
Good job! Thank you.

516
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44.600
Please, take her.

517
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55.680
That's the placenta there.

518
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57.680
Super. For you.

519
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58.720
Huh? For you.

520
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01.080
Eat it.

521
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02.320
It's tradition.

522
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04.640
For you.

523
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19.920
You're such a moron. That's gross.

524
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22.760
What? That's disgusting. I'd never eat that.

525
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27.560
You Parisians are stupid, huh?

526
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37.640
The hero of the day, as we all know,

527
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40.400
is the new presidential candidate, Stéphane Blé.

528
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43.800
After tense negotiations, he saved the life of Hervé Josserand,

529
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47.560
a farmer who had attempted to take his own life several times before.

530
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52.360
For more on the Blé case,

531
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54.920
tune into our broadcast this evening at 7 p.m.

532
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56.240
Montjoie Saint Denis!

533
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01.560
Blé has been hit! The candidate is down!
