00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13.040
Hey, Tarik. Can you give me the keys, please?

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15.400
Yeah, I'll get 'em for you. Thanks much, man.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17.080
Excuse me. Excuse me.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20.960
You, what do you do in… What do you mean by that?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23.360
No, it's a question. I'm not Am I asking what you do?

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25.200
Hey, no, wait. I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26.960
What? Lamine.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29.200
I'm taking the campaign digital. Ah.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31.960
He's the one sending out a tweet tomorrow about the State Thugs.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33.440
Totally. Do I think it's good?

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35.920
I'd say that the music video's junk, no real production budget.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37.240
But the song is real. Yeah.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38.400
"Marianne, you bitch." No.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40.440
It talked about how It didn't do anything good.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41.720
Just drop it now.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43.800
Let's concentrate on the team. Oh, yeah, the team.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46.720
I got someone great. There's Mo, there. He's my cuz.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50.120
He'll be in charge of my security. And he, uh, has experience in security?

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51.280
Yeah. He's listening.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53.080
I watched over Stéphane since we were boys.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55.520
He couldn't protect himself. Whoa.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57.880
In fifth grade, I kept fighting your bullies for you.

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59.400
I was in first grade. Come on.

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00.880
Yeah. That's actually good.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02.480
Security really isn't very complex.

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05.000
Just figure out which guys can't be trusted,

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05.960
and that's easy to do.

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08.680
Yeah. I can tell who's after Stéphane.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10.600
The Freemasons.

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12.600
What? Yeah. The state.

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14.360
Israel, that's obvious.  Whoa.

33
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16.560
What "whoa"? Whoa what? Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18.080
I'm speaking the truth. Well…

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20.760
Calm down, man.  You can't say anything anymore.

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23.240
We need to stop this, or he'll pull a real Benalla on us.

37
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25.880
Okay, I found the keys.  Ah, okay. Let's go.

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30.960
Bro, calm down. We're good.

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34.360
Voilà. There.

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36.640
Just be careful of the asbestos.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38.800
Huh? Uh, about the rats, chill.

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40.800
Clean up any trash and it'll be fine.

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41.760
So, enjoy.

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44.800
Welcome.  Why are you showing us this?

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46.920
A storage place, or what? It's our HQ.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49.480
It Our HQ, really? Yeah.

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52.960
Listen, we have a few weeks to get 500 mayors to support us.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54.640
We have to work from somewhere, right?

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57.160
I'll be working from my place.

50
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11.320
Thank you.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18.120
Bravo! Bravo!

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21.920
Listen, I did what you asked. I started my security firm.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24.400
Good. I have guys ready to make some money.

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27.800
But, uh, thing is, we're waiting for you. I mean… You know?

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30.240
Hey, remember who wrote your regulations?

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32.960
Remember who got you bankers? What can I give you now?

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35.000
As the mayor? Nothing, peanuts.

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36.640
Now, if I were the president…

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40.760
That's just a whole other scale, but I…

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42.480
I need to get elected.

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45.400
But some folks still keep on getting in my way.

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46.480
Like who? Your cousin.

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48.160
Oh. He isn't really much help.

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50.880
He's perturbing, see, because he splits up the left.

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54.800
And if he campaigns, I'm ruined. He'll split up our votes. You understand?

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58.320
So you wanna see if I can Sh!

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00.760
No, I'm not saying "want." I just ww….

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02.240
What means are you…

69
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03.800
I suggest he drops out?

70
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06.760
Uh. Yes, that way, we… Ah.

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09.520
Everyone can go ahead with their respective projects.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11.400
Hey, what? I touched your beard.

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12.720
Apologies. Watch it.

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14.240
No, I touched No. Don't do that.

75
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15.520
Lamine! Yeah.

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17.800
I know. That's what I keep telling you, man.

77
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19.800
Lamine! Yeah, I'm on the phone here!

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21.080
Hey. Poster. Huh?

79
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22.640
We good?  What's this?

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24.320
Yeah, there. Like that.

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26.080
Mmhmm.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29.560
Purple? Color of the Vatican, seriously?

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31.080
Hmm?

84
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32.880
The Pope. The Church.

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36.160
Slavery and colonization. Are you serious, dude?

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38.360
ItItIt's the Lakers too. Yeah, and kids too.

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40.720
The Lakers' kids? No, just for kids.

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42.400
Hello. Oh! Hey!

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43.760
How are you, Yasmine? I'm great.

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45.480
Hey, listen, uh, Stéphane.

91
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47.320
Let me introduce you to Yasmine. Hey. Great.

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50.320
She's going to take care of our campaign and strategy.

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52.080
She's a genius. She studied politics.

94
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53.680
Is that right? ENA. Top school. Wow.

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57.120
Great. Nice to meet you. Yeah, well, I'm super happy to be here.

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59.600
I've been waiting for a candidacy like yours for a long time.

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01.760
Yeah. Committed, socialist, radical.

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04.760
We'll beat everyone with our hard work. Well, yeah, cool.

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07.040
Yeah. Super happy. I saw you looking a bit lost.

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10.520
Let me introduce Didier. He's my Didi, my Did.

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12.640
The giant D. Oh, we caused a lot of trouble.

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14.040
Stéphane Blé. Hey there.

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16.720
It'll be nice to meet people, see new faces, chitchat.

104
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18.960
Since leaving the clinic, you know, I've been a little

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20.720
Hang on, what clinic? Because my wife

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22.200
Hey. Oh, you scoundrel.

107
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26.240
This guy here is getting us our sponsors. He knows everyone. He's a monster.

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29.000
There are 42,000 representatives, and he knows 40,000.

109
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30.080
Oh, yeah?  Yeah.

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31.960
Importantly, I know what they like. Yeah.

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34.640
For example, the mayor of Saint Goulinard, he likes Calvados.

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36.360
Saint Goulinard. He knows him.

113
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38.840
And then, GeoffrononOise, he just gobbles headcheese.

114
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40.760
Ah!  The one from PaurylesVignes…

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43.400
Yeah? He likes little Thai chicks.

116
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46.160
Eighteen, nineteen.

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47.920
Well, that's the legal age, so Yes, yes.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49.480
But we traveled to Pattaya together.

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52.040
We won't keep you here.  Right.

120
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55.400
Short on time and zero sponsors, so let's get moving. Uh, where's the

121
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56.400
Here's the list

122
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58.560
of who you'll go and visit.

123
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00.720
Okay? Yeah, it's all there.

124
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03.840
We're… We're rightwing? Yeah, rightwing.

125
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05.960
I'm super excited, so ready to start work with you.

126
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08.760
My pleasure. Impressive that the ENA has…

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10.480
Has? Has…

128
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14.440
Has what?

129
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15.960
Alumni, yeah.

130
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17.600
Okay. Yeah. Excuse me.

131
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20.240
I didn't say anything before about Didier, but he needs work.

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22.200
We have a zerotolerance policy on sexism.

133
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24.440
Next time, I'm reporting it.  Oh, I agree.

134
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25.840
So, uh, Yasmine,

135
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29.200
here are the big, important ideas that we're going to defend, right here.

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31.080
We worked hard on these. So, here they are.

137
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33.520
We got free cafeterias, more social diversity,

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35.920
universal income, more bonding between generations.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37.520
Listen, my goal is to win this.

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39.800
Yeah, well, me too. All right? Strong measures first.

141
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42.720
Mashallah. Identifiable. Let's examine Douanier.

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44.280
The Green candidate.  Yeah.

143
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47.240
Her zerowaste policy's intense. Each kilo's taxed a hundred euros.

144
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48.680
Yeah, crazy.  It's great.

145
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49.880
Just impossible to implement.

146
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53.240
So, we will find a measure that can punch, that slaps.

147
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56.280
Radical, disruptive. Uhhuh. Yeah. Mashallah. Disruptive.

148
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58.720
Totally. So, it's super great to talk with you.

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00.960
Uh, with us. Mashallah, mashallah.

150
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02.840
It would be even better… Mashallah.

151
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04.640
Seriously. Stop saying mashallah.

152
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08.600
You say it a lot.  Please.

153
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09.760
Alhamdulillah.

154
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17.880
Honestly, without strong measures,

155
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20.360
we won't get sponsors, and the campaign's over.

156
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22.120
Wait, wait. Easy.

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25.800
No, just eas Please, go easy. Don't thrust. Don't get crazy.

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28.920
I'm gonna jab it into the fat. There's more than enough here.

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34.920
A better living wage is strong, so that's my plan now.

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37.800
Uh, and, you've got those funds?

161
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40.400
Gonna sell the Eiffel Tower? No.

162
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44.200
No, seriously, you need to strike at the real problems.

163
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45.600
For an example…

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49.240
zero social charges on takehome pay.

165
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51.480
Boom. Simple, effective. People will get it.

166
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52.800
No, no!

167
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55.760
Zerointerest loans for all entrepreneurs.

168
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58.080
See? Like that.

169
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01.400
Come up with leftwing measures, since I'm left, at the core.

170
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04.960
All right, fine. Go and gimme the shot. I need to rest.

171
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06.960
Do it. Go ahead. But I did. I'm serious.

172
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09.040
No. No way.  I did.

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11.440
Wow.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15.040
Yes, I saw them both one night. He brought her to Maki's.

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17.640
You know, that kind of of African restaurant.

176
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20.320
Yes, he took her there to have fish.  Jeannette!

177
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24.560
I left the groceries on the third floor and some in the car.

178
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26.280
Bring those here, Stéphane.

179
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29.080
That bastard! He ruined me!

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31.400
He emptied my entire bank account!

181
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33.120
Just talk to her.

182
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35.800
I'llI'll talk to her, yeah. I won't be treated this way.

183
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37.800
Then go ahead, Stéphane. You have to do something.

184
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40.160
Hey, Jeannette, come on. It's polite to say "hello."

185
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54.320
Hello, Stéphane.

186
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56.120
Hi, Auntie. Hi, handsome.

187
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59.000
Mom, we need to talk about Jeannette. I'm not in your campaign?

188
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01.520
No.

189
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04.120
Oh, this is it! Yes. It's media monitoring.

190
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06.040
There. That's where you'll focus, Simone.

191
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07.120
So this, um… Yes.

192
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09.560
You'll take a notebook, like this, your tools.

193
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11.840
There's a TV in there. Watch every single channel.

194
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13.920
When someone says "Stéphane," bam, you write it.

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15.800
Yeah. That's it, love. Okay?

196
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18.160
Uhhuh. All right, Simone. Welcome on board.

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22.760
Uh, guys, I talked to Didier.  How's it going?

198
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23.800
He's struggling.

199
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25.040
Right now, what he needs

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27.200
is a strong argument to convince the mayors.

201
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28.680
So we need some real focus.

202
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31.600
We need the measure that lets you stand out from the others.

203
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34.520
Now, you're a nice guy who's Black and raps pretty badly…

204
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38.400
but evokes the block, you know, in some ways.

205
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39.360
But the bad block.

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41.600
The block that's dirty, the block that's disgusting,

207
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44.920
the block with riots, the block that's violent, uh…

208
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47.800
Gangs, Kalashnikovs, uh, abandoned babies.

209
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50.560
Uh, fridges that tumble off thethe rooftops on firemen

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52.320
who are saving people, what's more.

211
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54.360
Hey, William. The hijab. Sorry, what?

212
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55.440
That's plenty.

213
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58.400
We need a measure. There you are.

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00.720
Oh, you've settled in nicely.

215
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03.720
Pfft… Why's he here, dude?

216
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07.120
Why d'you hang around with this clown? He's family.

217
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09.400
He's family? I'm not family?  Yeah. Right.

218
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12.640
Yeah, you are. Aren't I family? Let's chat. Come on.

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14.200
Go on, Stéphane. We're good.

220
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16.640
I'll contact the polling institute to adjust your placement.

221
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23.040
Look, it's funny, your little stunt, but you know it's pointless, right?

222
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24.320
No, I wouldn't say that.

223
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29.000
Would you say that a Black president can win this?

224
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30.560
Hey, this is France, dude.

225
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32.880
If you were a manager at McDonald's, huge. What's this?

226
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36.320
The point's not to be the president. Feel me? It's about our message.

227
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37.440
Oh.

228
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42.680
Hey, dreams are great, but just look. There's no room for that here.

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45.240
Really? The president? You're losing it now, for real.

230
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47.440
Forget it. It's not for you. Why do you care?

231
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50.000
Tell me, what's your problem? It's not about me.

232
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54.680
But you're causing issues. You know, it's politics. It's dogeatdog.

233
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57.800
You think your guys gave a shit till you made it on TV?

234
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59.520
You don't matter to those fools.

235
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01.640
Me, I care about you. You care about me?

236
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02.960
Of course.

237
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08.240
Well, vote for me then in April. Excuse me. I've gotta work.

238
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11.000
Wallah. I'm gonna get those sponsors.

239
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26.960
These are people who aren't afraid to get up in the morning and…

240
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28.560
and get started working.

241
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29.680
Yes?

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32.520
Well, now, a lovely owner. Morning, ma'am.

243
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34.000
How may I help?

244
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36.520
How could you help me more than you already are

245
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38.080
with this splendid store?

246
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39.360
The enchanting salon

247
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43.040
that has such a wealth of life, such community and ethnic interactivity.

248
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45.120
And your braids are so beautiful.

249
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47.280
Can you take them away?

250
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49.440
We're gonna take a break. Let's step back.

251
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50.400
Let me stop you there.

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51.680
It's obvious why you're here,

253
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53.960
but I'm not part of the campaign with Stéphane.

254
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58.080
Your husband, Stéphane, is bound for a bright future, but…

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02.120
to get it, he needs to pick a side, like my side.

256
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06.040
We really need to block the right wing, chiefly the extreme right.

257
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07.920
Because, you'll agree with me,

258
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09.920
it's at our front door.

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10.840
Hmm?

260
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13.680
Tell me about your loan forfor the salon? How's that?

261
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17.080
Are you getting by? Making it work? You know about that?

262
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20.440
It's my city. I just keep track.

263
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23.720
Let me assist. I know people who do great work at the bank.

264
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25.120
And, in fact,

265
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28.840
I believe this lady is eligible for a municipalfunded loan support.

266
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30.160
The municipal aid fund. Mmhmm.

267
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32.760
For entrepreneurs and bolstering diversity. Yeah.

268
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35.080
That exists here? It does now, yes.

269
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38.720
Let me give you my card. Call anytime.

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42.960
I'll count on you.

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44.080
Talk to him.

272
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46.600
We need him, but on our own team.

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47.840
Right.

274
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50.920
I won't be voting for that guy. Look at his face.

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52.520
Mr. Andréï.

276
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55.000
No. That's not a reason.

277
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58.720
Don't vote for a face. Vote for ideas, all right?

278
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00.800
Now focus.

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03.120
Yes, often. But that's enough.

280
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09.920
No, go ahead.

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12.480
Just tell me, uh, what comes into your minds.

282
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13.840
And please, answer honestly.

283
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16.440
Well, it's a Black, uh, guy?

284
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17.520
Mmhmm.

285
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20.080
One who has a disability.

286
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22.200
Yeah, the, um, "Solutions come from below,"

287
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24.320
his legs were amputated, I bet.

288
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25.640
Oh, a paraplegic. Yeah.

289
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26.960
That's awful.  No, no.

290
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29.240
No, disability is, uh, missing the point.

291
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31.560
Uh, Stéphane here is running for president.

292
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34.480
And this study will help us understand how people see him.

293
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36.840
But isn't that the guy with the disgusting video

294
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40.120
where he insults Marianne, like, uh, says all that…

295
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42.560
He's… He's a piece of shit, that guy. Yeah.

296
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44.840
Well, let's go ahead. I'll say some words.

297
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48.240
And you raise your hand and tell me if they mean something to you.

298
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49.640
Okay. Confidence?

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52.400
Security?

300
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53.600
Well, "Black."

301
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55.280
Mm.  Mmhmm.

302
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56.960
Uh, "dealer."  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

303
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57.920
Yeah.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59.760
Um, uh, poverty.  Oh, yes.

305
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00.800
Mmhmm.

306
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02.080
Polygamy.

307
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03.880
Yeah, that too.  I agree.

308
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06.760
Uh, guys, it's a long shot.

309
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10.520
Your path is a very, very, very long one. Why say "a long way"? How much longer?

310
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12.600
We can catch up. I've never seen such bad results.

311
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15.040
Guy Georges as president has better chances than Stéphane.

312
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16.280
Whoa.

313
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18.280
Wow. The writer?

314
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20.600
No, that's George Sand. I mean…

315
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22.800
Guy Georges? Oh, shit!

316
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25.120
Guy Georges, the rapist? Yeah, the rapist. Yeah, yeah.

317
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27.000
Okay, we're very We're so beyond anything.

318
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28.520
Wow. Okay.

319
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31.000
What's after that, Hitler? Sorry, I need to take this.

320
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33.480
What could be worse?

321
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35.880
Yes, Etienne?  How did the study go?

322
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38.320
Your guy's doing all right? Listen, he's been doing great.

323
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41.560
No, really. The clip is, uh, completely behind us.

324
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42.880
It's done.

325
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45.480
So now, moving on, the priority is what?

326
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47.040
The sponsorships.  Okay.

327
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49.360
You absolutely need to bring me all those signatures, okay?

328
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52.160
I'll see what I can do. Otherwise, game over, finished.

329
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55.200
It can't be really possible that I'm rating lower than Guy Georges.

330
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56.760
He never ran for president, right?

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01.920
No, I'm being serious. HisHis image is, uh… Pfft.

332
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04.920
The sympathy he elicits is… It's crazy.

333
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07.400
I'm making it work anyway.

334
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09.880
You see, we just need to figure out this measure.

335
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11.520
Damn it.

336
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16.200
The right to vote at 15?

337
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18.040
You're grasping now.

338
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22.840
What's the matter?

339
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24.640
You want Peppa Pig?

340
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29.480
Here.

341
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34.680
Your daughter? No, she's my niece.

342
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38.960
But can you explain something to me? Peppa Pig is allowed?

343
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40.040
Isn't pork haram?

344
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42.400
And Peppa's a pig and all.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45.280
No, I'm really asking you.

346
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51.200
Well, Didier needs info on you to reassure the mayors,

347
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55.040
and the media will start digging soon, so let's explore your past, okay?

348
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58.520
All right. If there's a stain, we'll find it.

349
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00.480
No. I'm a hundred percent clean. Relax.

350
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02.400
Yeah? My past is clean. Oh, yeah.

351
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04.200
All right. So, fire away, huh?

352
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06.560
Okay, great. Any financial fraud?

353
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08.120
I get my tax exempted.

354
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12.120
Okay. We're good on the criminal record. Have you cheated on Ms. Marion?

355
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13.280
Are you mental?

356
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17.280
Hey, a hijab doesn't mean I don't know about things.

357
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20.280
If there's anything, come clean to me. That's not me at all, man.

358
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22.080
I have never cheated on Marion.

359
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23.440
No way.

360
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25.920
Okay, so you're clean regarding the MeToo movement?

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27.240
A hundred percent clean.

362
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28.760
So, yeah, keep on going. Okay.

363
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31.520
Not even some groping, some unwanted flirting?

364
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34.000
Dick pic? No way.

365
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36.320
Okay? Okay, okay. Not bad.

366
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38.440
"Not bad." It's normal.

367
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41.720
Oh!

368
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43.200
Yeah.

369
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46.120
Six or seven years ago, before I met Marion, maybe.

370
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47.520
I guess, I could've, uh…

371
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51.280
convinced a woman a little bit, not much, during a shindig.

372
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53.240
Nothing too… serious.

373
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56.280
Convinced how? Ah!

374
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57.760
You know, right?

375
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01.920
We were there drinking. We were wasted. You know?

376
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04.360
I mean, she didn't tell me, like, "no,"

377
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06.880
but I'm not sure she specifically said "yes."

378
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11.160
Oh, man. That's ancient! You know? Life, right?

379
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16.920
What happened exactly? Tell me.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19.000
I'm warning you, I'm not working for a rapist.

381
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20.960
No. Please, wait, Yasmine. Calm down.

382
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23.160
We need more data. You need to remember the girl.

383
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25.640
Calm down. Her name's not coming to me, man.

384
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28.360
You had sex and didn't even bother to remember her name, dude?

385
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29.760
Yo, I got a question, real quick.

386
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32.040
Uh, is it the candidate who needs to stay clean?

387
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33.800
Or like the whole entire team? Because

388
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36.400
The whole team. Oh, no. Please, no. Keep quiet.

389
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39.120
Listen, when was it? And where?

390
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42.200
You need to find me a name, an address. Anything. We need to find her.

391
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44.280
Because you realize that if not, we stop here.

392
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46.800
No presidential election, no campaign, nothing.

393
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49.760
You'll end up in prison, rotting, for assault.

394
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52.520
Stop it, Yasmine. Can you stop?  We need to face reality.

395
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54.040
But we don't know for sure.

396
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57.400
Please, Stéphane, you need to focus. Think hard. Where can we find this girl?

397
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58.320
I'm the same.

398
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01.800
'Cause my old girl went off talking shit to everyone because she left for months

399
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04.320
and I had a thing with a member of her family, her cousin.

400
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06.960
She was crazy. A memory. Think about it, hard.

401
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09.720
A street, a youth club.

402
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11.560
Come on.  A first name.

403
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14.040
I know.

404
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15.160
What are we doing? Stop.

405
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17.200
I knew he was weird from his face. What face?

406
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18.560
Judging a candidate What face?

407
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20.120
I'm not judging Worse than a voter.

408
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22.480
You can tell he's weird  Just be positive.

409
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24.480
If we start off thinking we're losing

410
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26.800
You think the mayors are gonna sponsor a rapist?

411
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29.760
Oh, great job. Presumption of innocence is over.

412
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33.680
Whoa. So what's this?

413
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36.200
Well, I remember she was a volunteer here.

414
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39.040
Oh, man. You're the presidential runner.

415
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41.240
Yeah, that's me. Yeah, I recognize you.

416
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42.760
It's cool you came to the fair.

417
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45.240
And we're trying to raise money for a ski trip.

418
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46.640
Oh, that's great.

419
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48.720
Come in. Ya'll are welcome.

420
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52.920
All right, my little president.  So where's this girl?

421
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55.920
She's there. Her, there?

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57.760
Yeah, in the pink. Okay, come.

423
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58.880
No.  Come on!

424
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01.840
Hello. Hi. Uh, yes?

425
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03.680
See that? What?

426
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05.800
She doesn't remember me. Wait, no. Go on. Go.

427
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07.800
Go on. Go ahead. Go, go.

428
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11.240
Do you remember, like six years ago, the party for Métalisé?

429
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15.520
I'm sorry? Apparently, there's history with you two.

430
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18.040
It's not much. You might not have even noticed.

431
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20.400
You know, it's possible it didn't occur.  Hmm.

432
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22.000
Try smiling. Maybe that's it.

433
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24.600
We met at Métalisé's birthday party,

434
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28.000
and, uh, after, we went back to mine, and we screwed, I think.

435
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30.640
So we wanna know if it was, like, uh….

436
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33.640
If it was consensual, you mean. Not "screwed" but "made love."

437
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36.720
Right, consensual.  It had to be, I think, right?

438
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39.360
Wow! My God!

439
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41.680
You're still alive. Why are you here?

440
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44.920
Well… actually, we were looking for you.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46.000
Oh, my God.

442
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47.880
It's all a blank? Well

443
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49.200
What did he do? It's

444
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51.040
You don't remember what happened that night?

445
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53.240
No, he doesn't remember. He, uh… So, what did… Why?

446
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54.560
Is it wrong? Nothing happened.

447
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55.640
Nothing?

448
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57.120
Not a thing. Not a thing?

449
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58.840
Nothing. Nada. Nothing means nothing.

450
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00.440
But wait, something went down. No, no.

451
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03.520
What happened is, we went back to yours because you were smashed.

452
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06.760
Afterward, you proposed we start banging. Okay. He requested.

453
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08.880
Hey, but I said no right away. She said no.

454
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10.640
You wanted to know if it was your teeth.

455
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12.840
I said yes. You started crying. Ha.

456
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14.640
You fell asleep. I left right away. Ah.

457
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16.640
Done.  Done. That means it's nothing.

458
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18.480
It was nothing, no rape.  Nothing.

459
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20.160
I meant, no contact. You what?

460
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22.800
No, nothing happened. This is great. He just cried.

461
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26.960
My apologies. Vote for Blé on April 10th. We're off now. Have a great night, day.

462
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28.840
Let's go. You sure we didn't bang?

463
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30.120
We're certain.

464
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33.160
It's fine. He's clean. We can start with the interviews.

465
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36.280
Wait, wait. Don't go yet.

466
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38.600
You wanna dance? No, no.

467
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40.920
Come on. Uh, yes. Well, of course he does.

468
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42.600
I mean, he's a killer dancer. No.

469
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45.760
As a new presidential candidate, you have to dance

470
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47.400
No, I don't want to.  Go, go.

471
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49.720
Come on. ♪ She ready, she ready ♪

472
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52.240
Yeah. Uh. Uh. Let's dance.

473
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54.200
Ay!

474
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55.320
What? What?

475
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59.920
Hey! Woohoo!

476
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16.640
Oh!

477
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17.840
That's hood.

478
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21.480
♪ Dee, dididee, dididee, dididay! ♪

479
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22.960
That's a bad sign.

480
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25.840
This is not good. Not good.

481
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30.160
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going with that?

482
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32.200
Look, Issa got all these drinks and snacks for us.

483
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34.960
She bought organic too. Hmm. This is all organic?

484
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36.520
He got this with coupons?

485
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43.680
That's actually our main measure.

486
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47.320
"Making meals… for a steal."

487
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49.960
Wait, wait. Are we stealing meals now, man?

488
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51.560
No, no, no.

489
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54.800
Making meals for a steal. Like free meals.

490
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57.400
Nothin' is free. Everybody's a customer or a product.

491
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59.640
You doin' this on purpose? This is France, okay?

492
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01.080
And we can vote.  Yeah.

493
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04.560
We have freedom of movement. Okay? And we also have freedom of speech.

494
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06.840
Freedom of speech, freedom of expression.

495
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10.040
Just not about the Jewish. Whoa, whoa. No, no, stop there.

496
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11.360
Okay.

497
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14.520
What I'd like is good nutrition for people here, okay?

498
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17.640
Imagine, grabbing a cart, going to the grocery store,

499
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19.120
and getting whatever you like.

500
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23.160
All organic food that uses supply chains that are short, uh, local.

501
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25.640
Then you don't have to pay a thing.  Good Lord.

502
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27.640
That's stealing!  No, Mom.

503
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30.360
It's a revolution. Uh, Stéph?

504
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32.200
Now, you and I know that I'm bad at math,

505
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34.320
but this revolution is gonna cost us billions.

506
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36.760
I mean, if every French person goes into a supermarket

507
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39.200
to buy organic produce and they don't pay,

508
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41.960
uhuh, how do we make it work for about 67 million people?

509
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43.720
He's right.

510
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46.120
This is absurd. It's nuts. It's completely impossible.

511
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48.440
Well, listen, I just ran the numbers, and it's costly,

512
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50.600
but in ten years, health care savings will pay for it.

513
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52.760
Wow. In 30 seconds, you did all that? That's right.

514
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54.480
Wow, okay.  Hold on.

515
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57.400
It must be. I don't We're gonna save much more than that.

516
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58.640
Picture my idea.

517
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00.640
If your meals are better, your mind is stronger,

518
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03.200
you study better, you mess up less.

519
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05.480
So there are fewer cops, fewer judges.

520
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08.400
We get these meals in fridges and we empty the prisons, guys.

521
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11.680
That's great.  Hallelujah!

522
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15.240
Hallelujah! All right. Okay. I mean, my

523
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18.200
No, I had this exact idea two years ago. Yeah, same one.

524
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23.600
So basically, the measure then is, "Making meals… for a steal."

525
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26.600
Amen!  It sounds great.

526
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28.760
I had the same slogan. Crazy.

527
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38.440
Make it "halal for a steal."

528
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40.160
And now…

529
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41.440
…you get the Arabs.

530
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45.600
Trust me, they're bunches. Too many. But that's another debate. That's, uh…

531
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49.000
Per square kilometer, you've got, uh…

532
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51.000
The mayors loved it.  Yeah?

533
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53.400
We're taking off like crazy. We've got loads of sponsors.

534
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56.080
It's gonna be a long road, but, man, this idea is awesome.

535
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57.520
Mm. What? Wait.

536
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00.280
Oh, hey, you know, Andréï came by just the other day.

537
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02.960
The salon.

538
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05.960
What did he want? To be helpful. To help me out.

539
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08.200
Shit.  Stéphane.

540
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10.640
He can help me with the loan.

541
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14.440
It could be such a weight off of us, a breath of fresh air.

542
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16.120
Especially with our, uh…

543
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19.920
We know you're not gonna be president.

544
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25.480
I mean, Andréï, he will be the president.

545
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27.560
Work with Andréï on his stuff.

546
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30.120
Just give him a couple of measures that you think matter a lot.

547
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33.480
It's a really, really awesome thing. So he waltzed in and turned you.

548
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34.560
Is that it? He didn't.

549
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36.800
He'll pay back your business loan for you, and that's it.

550
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40.640
Forget Négritude, Frantz Fanon What did you say? What was that?

551
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43.360
You're a great example of all the problems we have in Africa.

552
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44.440
Oh, all right. Okay.

553
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47.800
Someone shows up, flashes some cash, and there you go, all the sellouts start

554
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49.160
What? Wait, what? Me?

555
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51.160
Me? I'm a sellout? It seems so. Maybe, yeah.

556
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54.480
You're pretty content when this sellout works to pay the bills around here, right?

557
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57.000
And you're sitting there, "I'm gonna be president."

558
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00.640
A shiny dome with nothing in it! What can you do, except judge people?

559
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03.880
"I'm gonna be president." "I'm president." It's nonsense!

560
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06.080
You know what you are? Another Bokassa!

561
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07.800
What about you, Mobutu?

562
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10.520
With that nasty face of yours! Giscard d'Estaing!

563
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13.680
I completely understand, Marion. No, no, I respect his decision.

564
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16.600
It's one of the virtues of plurality, I believe.

565
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17.640
Yes.

566
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18.760
Yes. Yes?

567
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20.400
Uh, pardon me, your…

568
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22.840
Oh, your business loan! Of course. I'm here to help you.

569
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25.640
I myself will handle your case. You may count on me.

570
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29.920
All right. All right, all right. Goodbye then. You too. Bye now.

571
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34.080
You, miss, can put your loan up your ass.

572
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37.600
Thanks. Let's take a break.

573
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39.400
Jérôme!  Yes, what?

574
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41.280
Excuse me.

575
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43.360
You mind grabbing me some coffee, please?

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46.480
We're in deep shit. Why?

577
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50.080
Because that other idiot is campaigning. Apparently his wife couldn't convince him.

578
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52.080
Don't panic. The campaign is still ongoing.

579
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55.040
Not much longer. How is he with sponsors now?

580
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56.920
Well, I've put pressure on them to dismiss him,

581
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59.160
but I suspect the right's been helping.

582
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01.880
It's obvious the right is helping him out.

583
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04.560
He's not stealing their votes. He's stealing votes from me!

584
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08.480
I mean, last week, we were at 23. Now, it's 22.

585
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11.400
The barrier for the second round is 18. Eighteen.

586
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12.920
We must act. There's nothing to do.

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14.960
We must act quickly. You're the frontrunner.

588
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16.240
The top dog, number one.

589
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19.560
Blé won't last. You know that. You just need to concentrate.

590
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22.800
You'll get to the Elysée. You're almost there. Stay focused.

591
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24.360
Okay? Mm… no.

592
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27.680
Come here, Jérôme.

593
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30.560
You occasionally have good advice, but you're still a bit green.

594
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33.560
Strike a sharp blow soon, like that.

595
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36.920
What? I mean, play dirty.

596
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38.480
No, Éric.

597
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43.160
Now, I'm not expecting you to behave like a thug.

598
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45.720
See, me and you wouldn't behave like thugs.

599
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48.000
Regrettably,

600
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51.400
I manage a city with plenty of thugs.

601
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52.520
Plenty.

602
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55.440
Wonderful! Thank you.

603
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58.200
This sponsorship means a lot. Thank you so much, Mrs. Mayor.

604
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01.000
Or is it Mrs. Mayoress? I always forget.

605
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03.400
We accept the sponsorship with great pleasure.

606
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04.640
Thank you. Goodbye.

607
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07.680
Uh, Didier is en route.

608
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10.680
He's got our final sponsorship.

609
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11.920
Yes!

610
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13.320
We're now three hours away…

611
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15.200
Yo! …from the deadline.

612
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16.520
So we're pretty set.

613
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19.000
Yes! Yes! Yes! No way, dude.

614
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21.280
Hey, Stéphane, you did it! I told you, didn't I?

615
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23.160
You gotta dream big. I dreamed big.

616
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25.800
We dreamed big. That's how it goes. Exactly, man.

617
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29.600
Congratulations. Good work today. This is crazy. This is crazy. It's crazy!

618
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31.800
Didier? So? What?

619
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35.080
Sorry, guys. I called in every favor. I tried everything.

620
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37.440
I, uh, thought for sure the last one was set.

621
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41.040
I even offered to pleasure her.  Huh?

622
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44.280
No, just kidding. I think I did it. I don't know.

623
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46.880
Anyway, what we know for sure is…

624
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48.360
the sponsorship's gone.

625
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50.200
Fuck.  I don't believe it.

626
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52.480
I can't believe it. This is not happening!

627
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56.120
We can't stop at 499. C'mon people.  What a coincidence.

628
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58.640
What a complete coincidence, one missing.

629
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01.640
That's clearly a plot from the

630
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04.520
Can you just cut it out, all right?  Stéphane, what now?

631
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08.040
You really needed 500 signatures in order to run?

632
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10.000
If we don't have those, we're done.

633
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12.920
What if we do a robbery?  Mo, please, seriously, man.

634
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15.440
We're not kidding around.  I just think that if

635
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16.960
Man, stop talking nonsense!

636
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18.520
WHAT FUTURE FOR OUR PLANET?

637
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20.640
Behave yourself.  We have no business here.

638
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22.040
Let's bounce.  We do.

639
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24.480
She's a tree hugger. She likes Black people.

640
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26.920
And she hasn't given out her sponsorship yet.

641
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32.360
Good evening, sir.

642
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33.520
I'd like to know if

643
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35.440
And what makes you think I'm a man?

644
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39.680
Well, good evening, ma'am.

645
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41.240
I would just like to know Ah, okay.

646
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44.920
According to you, one's a man or a woman? I don't know.

647
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48.400
I mean, there are some certain elements that indicate that you are clearly a man.

648
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52.880
You have a beard, for one thing. Oh, yes, all men have beards.

649
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55.080
And women wear skirts. Hmm.

650
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57.440
In most cases, yes, that's how it tends to happen.

651
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00.680
Although there are bearded women. Come on, William, stop it. Excuse me.

652
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02.480
Where is Corinne Douanier, please?

653
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04.760
Over there. Thanks.

654
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06.600
What the hell are we doing here? What?

655
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10.160
It's Madagascar in here. You saw that guy. I don't know. Look at their faces.

656
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13.000
Tall people, skinny people, weird Calm down, calm down.

657
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14.040
John Lennon. Excuse me?

658
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15.720
Sinéad O'Connor there. Ah, greetings.

659
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17.320
Hello. Take this.

660
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19.320
No, let me handle this, please.

661
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21.560
Let me do it.

662
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27.320
Keep booking things. I'm in topnotch form.

663
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28.760
Yes? Hello.

664
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30.920
Hi, it's Stéphane Blé, a candidate for president.

665
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32.280
Yeah, I know who you are.

666
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35.240
Uh, William Crozon, campaign manager, éminence grise.

667
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38.160
The architect of all this. Aidedecamp, or chief of staff, if you

668
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39.520
I know what an aidedecamp is.

669
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41.800
Why are you explaining? Because I'm a woman?

670
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44.200
No, it's No, I'm like you, in politics.

671
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46.280
Being a woman, no problem. I went to school.

672
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49.000
It's crazy. You speak, uh… That was Chinese, right?

673
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51.000
Why? Because I recognized it.

674
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53.400
You were in China and everything for…

675
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54.440
Yeah. IsIs it

676
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57.000
Could we possibly talk outside for a few minutes?

677
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58.520
Yeah, I was just about to do rounds.

678
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59.480
Join me. Cool.

679
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01.440
Without this nohoper, though. I'm sorry.

680
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04.080
Wow. So that's a blunt attack there.

681
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06.320
Sorry, a "nohoper"? Please, that's… Oh.

682
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08.760
My greatest passion is politics. Hello. Calm down.

683
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10.640
Yeah, super, me too. I'm into politics.

684
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11.800
Not men in suits. Love it.

685
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13.640
No, they cut us off from our base, thanks.

686
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16.080
I'll be passing on that. Shall we? Yes, let's go.

687
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18.320
I'm not in a suit. It's a cardigan. Okay.

688
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20.440
Mismatched, with wornout shoes. Good evening.

689
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23.160
Oh.

690
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24.920
It's crazy what gets thrown out.

691
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29.000
So you're a mayor and a candidate. Could you give your sponsorship to me?

692
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31.600
It'll depend on what your politics are.

693
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36.520
Normally, I'm left. But with the mess they made, I'm not sure.

694
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39.000
Oh, but "neither left nor right" generally means right wing.

695
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40.000
No, but I'm not.

696
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42.880
I know I won't be elected, okay?

697
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44.880
I wanna talk about things we don't hear about.

698
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47.320
Like talk about associations that don't get funding

699
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49.280
and about folks struggling in the projects.

700
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50.520
My life.

701
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52.280
Thoughts on nuclear power are?

702
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54.720
Nuclear power, I don't give a fuck.

703
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55.840
Come on, no.

704
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58.520
Listen, there are kids going to school with empty stomachs.

705
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01.040
And some of them only eat once per day at school.

706
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03.720
That can't be possible here. We can't allow it.

707
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05.920
And folks need to hear about it. They need to know.

708
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10.280
Want it?

709
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13.160
Do you like green?

710
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15.440
Yeah.

711
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16.400
Please, take.

712
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18.000
It's not from a…

713
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29.000
And so, we have 500 sponsors!

714
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33.440
My man!

715
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36.080
To Stéph!  All right, man!

716
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38.880
We made it!

717
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41.600
I never could have done it, man. Wow. No way I could've.

718
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43.080
It's thanks to you, my brother.

719
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47.200
Hi. Thanks.

720
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53.960
Cheers, man. This is good. Good. Mmhmm.

721
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56.600
Thanks a lot. You made it work. Yeah, of course.

722
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00.360
Ah, yeah! Ah! Ah!

723
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04.040
Ah!  Ah, yeah! Yes!

724
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05.800
