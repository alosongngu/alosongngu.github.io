of the presidential election.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32.760
Regardless of the results in two weeks, it's a big moment,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33.960
because in two weeks,

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37.080
France will have either its first Black president

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38.600
or its first female president.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44.040
We are going to make you the first Black French president.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46.720

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN, FIRST ROUND

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48.160
The planet burns.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52.120
Its killers are men, and when I say "men," I don't mean mankind as a whole.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53.960
I mean it's men with penises.

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56.960
Their phallus, their balls, their member.

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58.760
Their junk, their dick.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59.720
Need I go on?

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01.920
The patriarchy is leading our world to its demise.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03.760
Hey, you're exaggerating.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05.480
No, no, no. Exaggeration's past.

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07.800
This is about our very survival now. Whoa.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10.480
On April 10th, cast your vote for ecofeminism.

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12.680
My dear compatriots, it's an upsurge.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15.240
Prices, unemployment, poverty.

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17.200
Even temperatures are climbing!

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18.840
Our response is obvious.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22.840
Kick all the Arabs out. Wow.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26.000
Citizens, cast your votes, and start winning back your pride.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28.360
The French are like me.  Oh, no. Not him.

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32.040
They are generous, caring, welcoming,

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33.360
brave.

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35.800
But often, they are also fatigued, drained,

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39.000
crushed by a political class that is no longer connected to reality.

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40.640
I must help. How?

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42.280
I've taken action as mayor.

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44.960
I've invested funds, specifically for our youth.

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49.280
You just butchered the budgets, liar. So, on April 10th, vote for a "yes."

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53.080
Yes to our French courage. Yes to our French ambition and generosity.

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54.360
Yes to a fair Fra

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56.640
"A fair France." Idiot.

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59.120
So, he invested. He invested in what, huh?

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00.560
What are you talkin' about?

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08.200
RIGHT BY THE BOOTSTRAPS!

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09.280
GREEN AGAINST ALL

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12.960
Let's see a pass, cheapskates. Huh?

71
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18.000
Boom. See that control?

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20.040
What's up, Stéphane? I'm good.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21.520
With that huge head. Yeah.

74
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23.560
Can't call me? I'll call, I promise. I'll call.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25.240
Yeah, you better. Just relax.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26.560
Stéphane, hey. How are things?

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29.040
It's pretty bad what you did with the kids' beach vacation.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31.640
What did I do, huh? Ibrahim counted down for two months.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34.600
You cancelled it. It wasn't me. It was him, girl.

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36.720
What? He slashed all the budgets.

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38.720
He closed down the civic center.

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41.160
What do we do about it? We have to vote. That's it.

83
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43.040
Well, yeah, but I And not for that guy.

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44.960
Not for president. Not for mayor. Nah.

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46.480
He's garbage! Garbage. That's right.

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47.800
Right, be safe, girl. Always.

87
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49.240
Stay in touch. Yeah, of course.

88
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52.320
Oh, yeah. Now the monitor's late. Look at that.

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55.000
Hey, get up! What is this? Cómo estás?

90
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57.880
What's up? You guys cool? All good.

91
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00.160
You clearly don't do your own laundry.

92
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02.040
Where's my phone?  Phone?

93
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03.800
Took it?  Eat and out.

94
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06.840
You're paranoid, hey?  What's in your pocket there, bro?

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09.040
Lamine, eat, get to class. What I thought.

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10.880
Give it back. It's fine.

97
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13.240
They were bustin' my balls, so I quit. You what?

98
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16.480
They looked at me sideways, like I'm the first Black guy they'd seen.

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17.720
It's bull.

100
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20.800
He's pissin' me off, this kid.

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22.600
Uh, Stéphane, are you

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26.400
Yo, Stéphane, just don't. Yes, hello.

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28.480
Ms. Sandalgian?

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30.520
It's Stéphane Blé, monitor for Lamine.

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32.680
Yeah, he'll be comin'. There was just a minor issue.

106
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35.040
But he'll be there. Knock it off. Just hang up, all right?

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36.440
WWhy is he late?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40.200
Uh, he's late because, um, his father just, uh…

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42.160
just passed away, regrettably.

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44.280
He passed away, yes.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47.280
It's a real tragedy in African culture. It's a blow.

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50.280
In the West too, huh? Okay, well, I see.

113
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53.080
It's This is the last time he'll run late to class, all right?

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54.160
I swear.

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58.800
Well, I mean that his father won't be passing away twice.

116
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02.680
I'm sorry. That's not funny. I'm sorry.

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03.920
Yeah, uh…

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05.600
Yeah, he'll head over. Thanks.

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07.480
Yo, that's crazy.  Just eat and go.

120
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09.600
Hey, Stéphane, this orange juice sucks.

121
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11.400
Are you serious?

122
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13.960
Have I not been providing for you?

123
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17.080
You better start doing it yourself, then. I mean, your dad's been in prison.

124
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18.720
You should be selfsufficient.

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20.440
I'm sorry, he what?

126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23.520
They told him his dad joined the army. Yeah, he's in the army.

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24.920
Yeah, yeah, in the army.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27.120
Doing pushups, training.  Why bring up prison?

129
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31.320
Clearly, when I talk about prison, I mean prison of the mind, obviously.

130
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33.440
The first prison is all mental. Hey, let's go.

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35.240
Andréï's talking himself up. He what?

132
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37.240
That mayor. Who does he think he is?

133
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50.600
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ANDRÉÏ: CAMPAIGNING IN THE FIELD

134
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53.680
You're a frontrunner, two months from the presidential election,

135
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56.200
but you've got harsh critics, and left saying you're rightwing.

136
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57.480
Hello, madam.

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00.600
Yes, yes, I know what they say. I'm left.

138
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04.120
It's really absurd rubbish, and I can explain that.

139
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06.840
My personal brand, I propose, is really a new left wing,

140
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07.960
one that's modern.

141
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10.120
A left that's not scared to push up sleeves

142
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11.320
and get some work done.

143
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13.560
That's the left I want to flourish.

144
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15.800
Quién está trabajando aquí? I'm sorry?

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18.600
Yes, I'm bilingual. Surprised?  Oh!

146
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21.640
Stéphane! How are you, sir? I didn't recognize you.

147
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23.320
Stéphane works at the youth center.

148
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26.480
Superb work effort, Stéphane, truly. Cut the bullshit.

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28.280
Okay? You know what we all want.

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29.400
Right.  Respect.

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31.880
Don't make living around here a kind of handicap.

152
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33.560
We don't want that. We don't want that.

153
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36.880
Well said. Of course. Well said.  We want the same thing!

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38.640
I completely understand. You're right.

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40.880
ButBut I want the same things, just like you all.

156
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43.760
Especially since I lived here. My life was in the 'hood.

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46.600
The Republic gave me everything. I wanna give in return.

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48.640
Give in return or take everything from us?

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50.640
Okay.

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52.080
We have to go.  Tell him!

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54.520
All you've done in five years… No. Go on, please.

162
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57.840
…is cut the budget for all our community associations.

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00.080
And you tripled the budget for video surveillance.

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01.000
No, but, I

165
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03.640
You know, sir, I can say that Don't call me sir, all right?

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04.720
Just stop it. All right.

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06.080
You've known me for years, Éric.

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08.280
Can you quit putting on a show? It's for the cameras.

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10.240
Don't keep putting on a show. You're correct.

170
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13.760
You are correct here, friend. You are. Don't pretend like we're buddies, please.

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16.840
You need to respect people. Uh, well, listen to me. Listen to me.

172
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21.000
IfIf elected, I will definitely support…  We don't wanna listen to you!

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24.840
…young professionals. That's how we help. Right, "professionals."

174
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28.200
Being doctors, lawyers, engineers. Not people like us, huh?

175
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30.680
We work in kitchens. Nothing left to say, right?

176
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33.160
Put on your aprons, guys. No, no, no. Stéphane.

177
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36.960
Stéphane, now, just one thing at a time. We need to pace things.

178
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39.680
Hey, nobody's scared of rolling up sleeves, Éric.

179
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41.520
Believe me.  Yeah, tell him!

180
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43.520
Yes, but I'm just saying That's right, nobody.

181
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46.320
When you're getting fucked over working, sleeves don't matter.

182
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49.400
Whoa!

183
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51.360
That's well said.  Hey. Wait, wait.

184
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53.680
Are you looking for a slogan for your campaign?

185
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54.600
I got one for you.

186
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57.080
I can't wait to hear it. Go ahead.

187
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59.560
It's "Liberty, equality, brotherhood."

188
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02.200
Whoa!

189
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08.360
All right, salaam.  Mr. Andréï, over here.

190
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12.120
Mr. André No, no. No comment, no.

191
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14.040
No, no, no.  Thank you very much.

192
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17.880
Your job is at risk.

193
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20.080
You're better off having a few kids,

194
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22.000
instead of acting like a moron for the cameras.

195
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24.000
How's that goin'?

196
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26.560
Guess how many grandkids Jeanette has.

197
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27.960
Eleven. Twelve.

198
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28.960
Amen.

199
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30.280
Say "amen"!

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32.880
Amen. Twelve grandchildren.

201
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34.760
And me, zero.

202
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38.160
Well, we've been, uh… Well, Marion  Yes, we are, but it's hard.

203
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41.080
We're doing everything, Simone, I swear, you know, but

204
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43.440
You don't desire Marion now, huh? Huh?

205
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46.160
She's gained some weight recently, but she's still beautiful.

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49.280
Mom, that's… Your father, rest in peace…

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51.840
He's not actually dead. He should be.

208
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54.720
His soldier had problems some nights. Wow.

209
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56.320
You can talk to me about it.

210
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58.080
Uhhuh.  But it's not…

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00.800
I mean, having a kid is a lot of pressure.

212
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02.840
And financially, it's been really hard.

213
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05.080
I'm still paying off the business loan on the salon

214
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07.320
I talk to her about a child, she talks about a loan.

215
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12.000
Hey, it's typical from Beninese. She's not Beninese. She's Senegalese.

216
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15.200
Togolese, Beninese, they all love their money, right?

217
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16.120
What's that?

218
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18.920
Uh, is this a friend, Mom?

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22.040
Oh!  This is Jeanette. She's my close church friend.

220
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24.240
Mm.  Her husband is a bad man.

221
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26.400
Mmhmm. She'll stay at your place for now.

222
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28.600
Huh?  I don't have room at mine.

223
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm sorry, but that's not possible, Simone, because, you know,

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35.120
at the moment, in the bedroom, we're doing the whole, um…

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37.000
What's it called, Stéphane? Hey, Stéphane.

226
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39.720
You're the one handling it. Stéphane.  Hold on.

227
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42.120
I don't know a single person here

228
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44.720
who's scared of rolling up sleeves, believe me, Éric.

229
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47.280
When you're getting fucked over, sleeves don't matter.

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49.600
Stéphane Blé is a monitor in a community center

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50.960
in a housing project,

232
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53.440
and seems perfectly ready to challenge Éric Andréï directly.

233
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57.160
Yes, absolutely a nightmare for the candidates that are on campaign.

234
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00.160
Random guy comes along and just dynamites a visit.

235
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02.280
Apparently, the man's no longer anonymous.

236
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05.720
The media machine has been quite busy developing "Blémania."

237
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09.160
The guy is trending on Twitter. It looks like he's got good punchlines.

238
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10.920
So, we asked a polling company,

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13.640
just as a joke really, to run a little test,

240
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15.920
in the perspective of the presidential election,

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17.240
should he ever run.

242
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18.520
How do you think he scored?

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20.760
One percent?  No, four percent.

244
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23.400
Four percent for a twominute segment on TV?!

245
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25.360
If you relate that to the electorate,

246
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26.920
well, that's about two million voters.

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29.160
Two million. That's crazy. Two million?

248
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31.720
See how lucky you are to be with my son?

249
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32.760
Two million!

250
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43.560
Wow, Stéph. You're in the paper!  Yeah.

251
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46.760
It's crazy. You're right there. Look at that.

252
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47.800
How are you? I'm good.

253
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50.040
We just saw you on TV yesterday with the mayor.

254
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52.720
Oh, thank you. Thanks, Auntie. You were topnotch.

255
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55.040
Hey, you totally owned the mayor, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56.880
Great, man. Thanks, thanks.

257
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58.880
Stéphane!

258
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02.400
Stéphane, some questions. Are you gonna run for mayor?

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05.560
So, what's your perception of secularism in France?

260
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07.600
Are you going to run opposite Andréï?

261
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10.320
No, I'm just a citizen who's sick of getting my ass kissed

262
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12.960
every five years or so, and getting boned otherwise.

263
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14.680
That's my position. Any more questions?

264
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16.560
Okay, no more questions.  Is it

265
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18.720
Okay, no more comments. Wait. We have more questions.

266
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21.520
No. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Thank you.

267
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23.000
All right, come on.

268
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24.000
Who are you?

269
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25.920
William Crozon.

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28.440
I've directed campaigns for about 15 years.

271
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30.800
I've helped elect greats, the best.

272
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34.920
And also idiots. But our politics are my life.

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37.840
And you, my guy… you're unique.

274
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42.240
Just between us, you must be sick of all the white politicians

275
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43.720
that fuck with us.

276
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46.680
It's because no one represents guys like us two.

277
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47.880
Are you Turkish?

278
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50.480
Because you don't look Black, man. Huh?

279
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52.160
All right, you just Arabized.

280
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54.600
No, you pleb, you Islamized

281
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56.640
the grandnephew of the great Aimé Césaire.

282
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59.160
Huh? Oh, yeah? No big deal. The inventor of Négritude.

283
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01.400
Yes, yes. I know, I know. Yeah, well, whatever.

284
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07.040
Yeah, seeing you, despite the teeth, you're perfect.

285
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08.240
Have you been in jail?

286
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09.880
No. You married?

287
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11.480
Yeah. That's perfect.

288
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13.200
Any kids? No.

289
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14.640
Get some. Lots.

290
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15.560
Are you gay?

291
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17.640
What the hell, man?

292
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20.200
Man, you're bein' crazy, right? I'm not gay, all right?

293
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22.280
Okay, yeah, you got a problem with that.

294
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25.040
But just wait. I'm from the 'hood. I know how people feel about gays.

295
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28.120
No. No. And I don't appreciate what you're insinuating here.

296
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29.920
Uh, the guys in the 'hood have evolved.

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31.880
It's not like you're making out. Mmhmm.

298
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33.640
On my block, there's a family. Hmm?

299
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37.040
Uh, there's two brothers, and the two are gay men.

300
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38.720
And Arabs to boot. Wow.

301
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40.480
And?

302
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43.400
Well, the same family.

303
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45.440
Okay. And?

304
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48.800
There's two. There's two, I mean…

305
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54.760
That's my bad. There. You need to change that, okay?

306
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58.360
Get rid of all these revolting ideas, because now you've got credibility.

307
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01.320
You're great, you're unique. Me, I've got savvy and a strategy.

308
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03.160
I've got savvy too. Yeah, all right.

309
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05.080
But not as much. Now, listen to me.

310
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09.040
Two Black guys, the two of us, in the Elysée, my guy.

311
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11.840
You get me? The new Barack and Michelle.

312
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13.400
Just hang on one second. Boom!

313
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14.720
Stop right there.

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17.600
Who's Barack and who's Michelle in all this?

315
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19.920
This guy. Go on, just elaborate for me.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22.440
You have a real problem with that. It's crazy.

317
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24.000
I don't wanna bang you, man.

318
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26.880
I want to transform you into the president

319
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28.080
of France, my guy.

320
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30.280
But I'm not in politics anymore. You were in politics?

321
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32.680
Well, yeah, back in the day, with my band State Thugs.

322
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33.840
We were all dedicated.

323
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35.880
But that's behind me now. It's over.

324
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36.960
It's not behind you.

325
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40.720
The guy I just saw taking down Andréï has that rage.

326
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43.280
He made me angry, trying to lecture us, you know.

327
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45.560
All the real solutions rise from below.

328
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47.000
Oh, this is it. That's right.

329
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57.560
Creole. I was raised in the Antilles.

330
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00.360
It sneaks out when I get angry. How it is. Remember the commonwealths?

331
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02.400
Oh, no, I remember the Antilles, man. Of course.

332
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03.760
No, of course.

333
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06.640
Hmm. Mm.

334
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10.600
We'll do great things. I swear. I can see it now.

335
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13.400
Because you represent the block. You represent the voiceless.

336
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16.600
You represent those who feel oppressed, those who feel hopeless.

337
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18.280
All those guys, me, livin' in Sarcelles.

338
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19.640
You know Sarcelles? Totally.

339
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22.040
You know CMurder, Give, all that? Pfft.

340
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24.040
Yeah? My guys on the block!

341
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25.320
Uh, but where in Sarcelles?

342
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29.720
Uh, uh, next to Next to, uh, CMurder, yeah.

343
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31.200
We all They all But where?

344
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33.880
Which area were you in?  Uh…

345
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35.840
Tartier, Tartlet, Tartelet?

346
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37.720
Is that right, "Tartlet"?

347
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39.960
Oh shit.

348
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42.400
Hey, you have my card, right? My card!

349
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45.720
The Tarterets! Shit.

350
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48.120
Yes?  Seriously, what are you doing?

351
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51.280
I'm at the clinic waiting. I know, sorry. I'll be right there.

352
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53.280
You're such a pain. Don't worry. Soon.

353
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55.720
If this is gonna work, you need to get serious.

354
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58.400
Shit. I'm waiting here, and you're not answering.

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01.560
It takes two to make a life. If you're not up for it, say so.

356
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03.360
Stéph?

357
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06.560
Stéph? Are you there?

358
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12.080
Ah, my cuz. Why are you hiring Lamine? Bro.

359
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14.360
What's wrong with you?

360
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17.120
How many ways can I explain we don't talk about that here?

361
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18.320
Are you mad?

362
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21.360
The kid's in a training program. He has to finish. Please.

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23.200
Seriously. All right, come on.

364
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25.640
Djibril, say hi to your uncle.

365
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28.400
Hi, Djibril! What's up?

366
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30.360
I don't give a crap.

367
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33.240
He's not working for you. Lamine's the same as the others, bro.

368
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35.280
The boy wants food in his fridge, same as the rest.

369
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37.160
No, he's different, and for years now,

370
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39.320
Marion and I have looked out for his best interests.

371
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40.280
Please.

372
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42.920
Fine, I'll pay him for today and send the kid home.

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45.720
Good? All right?  Okay. Thanks, bro.

374
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49.400
All right, we'll begin with ten to 12 days of hormone shots.

375
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51.160
Then we'll begin collecting your oocytes,

376
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53.040
and while we're at it, your husband's sperm.

377
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55.200
Or your, uh… From your…

378
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57.000
I mean, is there a donor? Your husband?

379
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58.640
Supposedly, yes. I'm here, I'm here!

380
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00.600
Ah. How's everything going?

381
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04.680
Hi, hon. Mwah. You're that guy on the TV.

382
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07.040
Hmm?  On TV.

383
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08.920
It's you? Yeah.

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11.360
Impressive. You murdered Andréï.

385
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13.640
If you ran for office, I'd for sure vote for you.

386
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17.320
Him, campaigning? Oh, please. Almost missed our meeting, didn't you?

387
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18.680
It's just that I had an issue.

388
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21.560
I'll tell you later, but I'm here 200 percent, promise.

389
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22.840
Right here, my love.

390
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25.720
You mean that, right? Yeah.

391
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28.400
You mean you know what'll happen? Yes.

392
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31.240
Because I need to give myself hormonal injections daily.

393
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33.520
It'll be quite hard, obviously.  Mmhmm.

394
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35.840
You have to provide some, uh, well…

395
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36.920
Uh, some Your sperm.

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38.880
Sperm, and… Ah.

397
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41.600
…you're also gonna have to make sure it's fresh by tasting it.

398
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42.800
So, uh What?

399
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45.600
Oh, please. It's fine. Don't be a prude.

400
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48.400
You just put a… a bit on your lips, like this.

401
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52.200
A bit like gloss, you know? Just to see if it has any flavor. Simple.

402
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54.680
But if that's too hard, you just put it right here.

403
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57.560
Like a bottle, you know? Yeah, a bottle.

404
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01.160
There. And it's not that crazy. Everybody's done it. It's not like, uh…

405
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07.840
Yeah, I've tasted it. That's true.

406
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09.520
I can say that, yeah.

407
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15.320
What's four percent? Four percent isn't serious.

408
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17.560
My mother could beat that. It's four percent!

409
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20.080
Still, he's stealing it from you, the four percent, right?

410
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22.200
Yeah, I know. That's right.

411
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26.040
Fifteen years. He's been there for 15 years!

412
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28.680
And it was me who got him this job.

413
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30.360
Me!

414
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33.880
If I still worked in the Interior, I'd red flag him, huh?

415
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36.520
Blé doesn't matter. No, he does matter.

416
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38.760
The guy is just hot air. That's all he is.

417
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40.960
So, tomorrow, informally invite him to your meeting.

418
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42.120
Easy.  No way.

419
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45.120
We're fine, we'll make it, but we must maintain voter diversity.

420
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47.920
"Diversity." You're pissing me off with your diversity!

421
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50.160
Diversity is everywhere with you! Madness!

422
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54.200
Under my flyers, in my campaign. I'll have to go to bed with diversity!

423
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56.960
I'm a giver. I give. Where's my gratitude?

424
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00.320
They spit on gratitude! I'm leftwing, true, but I have limits.

425
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02.480
There. You wanna spend all morning on this?

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04.200
No. Good.

427
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05.920
But I needed to Yeah, yeah.

428
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08.640
Tomorrow, you'll give him some candy and move on ahead.

429
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09.640
Hmm. Yeah?

430
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11.160
Yeah. There's more important things.

431
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13.840
Yes, my platform. Well, yes.

432
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16.560
They vote for platforms, and they also vote for…

433
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18.560
a presence, an air, a look.

434
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21.120
With his face, I like my chances.

435
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23.320
Yeah, but he's got style, a "thing."

436
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24.280
While you…

437
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26.600
Yeah, me?

438
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28.760
We'll fix it.

439
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31.840
All right, then.

440
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41.800
Did you see that yesterday? Ibrahim got smashed off his board.

441
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43.080
Oh, yeah? He got hit?

442
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45.920
Yeah, he did. I swear.  Well, he is a loser.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47.840
He went flying. I'll call you back.

444
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49.240
Yeah.  Did he actually?

445
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50.480
Hey!  Shit!

446
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52.480
Don't you move! Hold it! Stay right there!

447
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04.320
Stéphane.

448
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06.280
Lamine just got picked up by the cops. What?

449
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07.680
Yeah, he got caught. Just now.

450
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09.360
Just now? Yeah, they just got him.

451
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10.320
Shit.

452
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13.200
What are you doing? Go on now. Coming with you.

453
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15.160
I've told you three times!

454
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17.800
His home situation's complicated. That's why I'm here.

455
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20.360
And if you're not his mom or dad, or court guardian,

456
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21.920
he can't possibly go with you.

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22.920
Move on.

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24.800
Oh, come on, dude. Next. Ma'am.

459
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26.800
No way I'm moving without Lamine!

460
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29.000
He can't miss his course or he'll get kicked out.

461
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30.120
Fine. That's fine.

462
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32.480
As an outraged citizen, your behavior is unacceptable.

463
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35.480
I want the person in charge of you. That's it. Now. Congrats.

464
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39.120
Are you talkin' to me like that?

465
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40.560
I'm sorry?

466
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48.600
If rights were violated, the shit will hit the fan!

467
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52.760
Every person in here has the right to a confidential meeting with a lawyer.

468
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56.440
Article 631 of the criminalprocedure code.

469
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59.200
You want Internal Affairs on your ass?

470
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01.360
Have a good night. Thanks.

471
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03.440
What are you doing here? Uh…

472
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06.400
I'm gonna get you and the kid out. Don't worry.

473
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07.600
And, um…

474
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10.800
between us, it's pretty cool you're locked up here.

475
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12.080
It's like Mandela. Fabulous.

476
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13.760
Hold on. What about Mandela?

477
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15.760
Oh, Mandela? He's Black, just like we are.

478
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19.240
Twentyseven years in jail. While you've had two hours? A bit less?

479
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22.720
Huh, close. An hour forty. Half an hour. An hour and a half.

480
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24.040
Anyway, you've done time.

481
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26.360
Suffering as a political prisoner,

482
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27.680
just like him!

483
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30.920
I'll use this to stir up the neighborhood. I'll appeal to the press.

484
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34.480
And once you're out, you will announce your candidacy for president.

485
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35.600
Oh, man, no! Hey!

486
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37.960
I said no. I can't be doing that, man.

487
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39.200
I've got my job.

488
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41.360
I want a kid with my wife. I can't be doing this stuff.

489
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44.080
What world do you wanna give your kid? Tell me.

490
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47.000
A world where as soon as he steps out of line,

491
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48.160
he'll get taken down?

492
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51.120
A world where he gets locked up just because he's Black?

493
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52.240
That kind of world?

494
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59.760
Is that Creole again? It's Frantz Fanon, a quote.

495
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02.080
When he bounced to Algeria for training thethe…

496
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04.960
The guys for the Algerian revolution. Did the Algerians speak Creole?

497
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07.840
I think there were speeches later in French and that's probably

498
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09.600
Look.

499
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12.400
What is missing in the world today, huh?

500
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16.360
It's hope, man. Tell me, how is hope born?

501
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17.440
It's just a glint.

502
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19.440
And that little glint…

503
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21.640
could be you.

504
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27.160
Or maybe someone else. Who knows?

505
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31.840
That's what's interesting, I find. Right?

506
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35.080
I'll get you out, man.

507
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46.640
Liberate Stéphane Blé! Liberate Stéphane Blé!

508
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48.560
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

509
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50.120
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

510
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52.160
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

511
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54.000
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

512
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55.960
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

513
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58.000
Yeah! Let him go! Liberate Stéphane Blé!

514
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02.280
Liberate Stéphane Blé! Liberate Stéphane Blé!

515
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03.560
Liberate Please, everyone.

516
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05.800
I'm gonna ask you to disperse now. Yeah?

517
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07.120
"Disperse." Sure. Go on.

518
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09.000
No justice, no peace.

519
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11.000
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

520
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13.000
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

521
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15.400
Liberate Stéphane Blé! Yeah! Why, huh?!

522
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16.560
Liberate Stéphane Blé!

523
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18.920
We'll be here until Stéphane Blé has been freed.

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20.880
Fine. Okay, gas 'em all.

525
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22.160
Huh?  Liberate…

526
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24.320
Go ahead. Gas them all. No, no, no, no!

527
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25.920
No, no, no, no! Liberate Stéphane Blé!

528
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28.600
They're gonna gas us! He's gonna gas us! He's gonna gas us!

529
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30.920
Liberate  Ah!

530
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35.240

Oh, shit.

545
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16.240
Have you decided?

546
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19.760
What d'you think?

547
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22.160
Well,

548
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24.680
you've always said I should dream big.

549
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27.160
And, uh…

550
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31.280
And I think, really, president sounds great.

551
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38.840
Dude, no. You'll never be president.

552
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42.640
Hey, this is France, not the United States.

553
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44.880
Here, they like Black folk if they're funny,

554
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46.880
if they bring home the World Cup,

555
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48.400
or if they do gospel, period.

556
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50.200
Okay, all right. So I'm not funny.

557
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53.080
I don't dance much. I don't do gospel. Okay?

558
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54.400
I'm not really a president,

559
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56.840
so I wanna put the spotlight on real voters.

560
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00.320
People. People from real life. Basically, people like us both.

561
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04.000
But I need you as a partner. Mandela without Winnie isn't Mandela.

562
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05.880
Mmhmm.

563
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07.200
Mmhmm.

564
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08.480
You doin' all right?

565
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15.600
You know they ended up getting divorced?

566
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17.320
Yeah?

567
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19.320
You're terrible. I knew.

568
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20.680
Of course I did.

569
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22.080
Hey, we're so much stronger.

570
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24.560
Than Mr. Mandela? What? With you, yeah.

571
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41.720
Okay.

572
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43.480
I'm in, if you're in for us.

573
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45.640
You'll give me the injections.

574
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49.080
All the injections. I'm needlephobic. Be at every single gyno consult.

575
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51.160
And be on time, because I know you. Right.

576
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53.040
And most importantly, please…

577
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55.280
don't become a politician.

578
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56.240
Me?

579
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57.800
You. Me?

580
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58.760
You! Me?!

581
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59.680
You!

582
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01.840
Stéphane Blé.

583
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06.480
Mm.

584
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08.400
Thank you.

585
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10.280
The reason I'm here today, everyone,

586
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13.280
is to tell you all that I'm running in the presidential elections

587
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14.360
of the French Republic!

588
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21.960
I'll admit, the guy you see here running for president, it's crazy.

589
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24.120
But for me, what's most crazy

590
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26.920
is that 70 percent of the French don't vote!

591
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30.240
One day every five years, that's our power, that's what we get!

592
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33.520
What I want is to give us power every day of the damn year!

593
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35.880
Amen!

594
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37.240
Amen!  That's right!

595
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40.080
People here know me. I'm a social worker in the community.

596
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41.800
And the work I do with our kids

597
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44.360
is what I'd like to do, but I wanna do it on a national scale.

598
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46.040
Yeah!

599
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47.600
Yeah! Let's go!

600
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52.240
The real problem with all these elections is

601
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53.520
Mr. Durandeau.

602
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55.200
How are you, sir?  I'm fine.

603
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57.720
Are you watching this? Mmhmm.

604
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58.840
You hear this?

605
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02.400
They don't know about family allowances. They were never without a mom or dad.

606
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03.880
They never had to share a room.

607
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05.800
This is my latest protégé's speech,

608
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07.000
announcing that he's running.

609
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10.520
Look at him. I think he's gonna kill it. I heard about him. And you want?

610
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14.360
Would you like to keep Andréï out of this match?

611
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15.880
How would that happen?

612
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18.520
Well, you help me to look for sponsors,

613
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21.120
and my guy will steal around seven to eight percent,

614
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22.440
we siphon the left votes,

615
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25.920
and Andréï bombs out quick, and your road has been cleared.

616
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28.840
Mmhmm. And in exchange? Easy.

617
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31.800
I want a job. Is that all?

618
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33.960
You've got some nerve. Interested or what?

619
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39.200
I'll get some sponsors, and we'll speak again, hmm?

620
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45.800
Amen!

621
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48.000
And what I wanna prove is

622
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50.680
that you can be Black, you can come from the projects,

623
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53.480
not wear a suit, and love France, yo!

624
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57.760
Because really, France is yours! And France belongs to all of us!

625
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03.600
Blé, president! Blé, president!

626
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05.160
Blé, president!

627
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08.000
Blé, president!

628
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11.960
Blé, president! Blé, president! Blé, president!

629
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14.160
Blé, president! Oh! Ah!

630
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15.720
Blé, president! Ay!

631
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20.720
Blé, president! Blé, president!  Oh! Yeah!

632
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24.080
Blé, president! Blé, president!

633
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26.760
Blé, president! Blé, president!

634
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30.600
Blé, president! Blé, president!

635
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33.280
Blé, president! Blé, president!

636
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36.360
Blé, president! Blé, president! Blé…

637
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40.040
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha! Audi B, my State Thugs!

638
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44.440
My State Thugs! 2005, the year of success!

639
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48.280
