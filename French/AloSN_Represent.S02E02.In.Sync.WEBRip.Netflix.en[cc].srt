1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25.680
I don't think he likes applesauce.

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28.680
I don't give a fuck. You feed your hostage.

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31.480
Do you know the Geneva Convention? Hold on, he's not my hostage.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34.360
He's not my hostage. Who brought him here? He's your hostage.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35.600
But I…

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39.680
Why is he taking so long, for fuck's sake?

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41.800
Honestly, it wasn't a good idea to call him.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44.800
Who did you want us to call? Yasmine? She'd have killed us.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46.600
You didn't give me a choice.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48.920
He's the only one who can get us out of this mess.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51.240
So, what's the minor issue you've got?

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56.400
What the fuck is this, guys? What are you doing? Who is this?

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00.680
That's the Norwegian ambassador. Huh? What?

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03.400
I swear, my heart was in the right place.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06.240
It's all right. Mo gave him a little roughing up, nothing too serious.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07.480
Roughing up? Look, he's fine.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10.160
Yeah, but honestly, he looks like a Nazi.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13.480
Come on, dude, you need to stop thinking that all blonds are Nazis.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15.440
There were Nazis with brown hair, with red hair.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17.640
There were fat Nazis, skinny Nazis, women Nazis.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19.640
It's a super inclusive group, FYI. Come on.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20.720
Okay.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24.400
Fuck, I thought this was a minor issue, like you two groped an assistant.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26.080
But this is some major shit right here.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28.160
That's fucked up.  What made you do this?

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30.040
We need your help. That's why we called.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32.600
If you get us out of this, I'll reinstate you on the team.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37.520
Shut up.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38.600
I swear.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41.440
Are you serious? Tell the truth.  Yeah. I swear.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43.640
At the Élysée. With a driver, everything.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47.120
Oh, fuck, man. That's awesome.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50.120
Well, don't worry. We're gonna figure this out. Hmm…

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52.160
Did he recognize you guys? Did he see you?

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53.720
No, no. Okay. All right.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54.760
Take a look. Look.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59.000
When we took off his blindfold, we put on our masks.

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00.720
Yeah. So he fucking saw you guys.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02.680
I told you these weren't the right ones!

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04.760
Some of them are opaque, so you can't see the face!

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06.600
Well, uh, there's only one solution, guys.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08.720
Good thing I came with a utility vehicle.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11.560
I can park with the trunk facing the Élysée,

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14.000
open the the back doors, you put him in there,

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15.320
and we bury him in the forest.

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16.640
I like it. That's a great plan.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18.560
You can't be fucking for real. What's up, man?

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20.360
I'm not killing anybody. That's not my style.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21.840
You won't kill him. I will. No.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23.560
He committed suicide. He was depressed.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26.840
You're full of it! I won't kill anyone. The Élysée has a number of body counts.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28.320
Mitterrand with Coluche.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31.200
Dalida, Balavoine, "L'Aziza."  Claude François!

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33.240
Him too? Of course. It was jumper cables.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34.280
Not a hairdryer.

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38.360
What's that?

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40.840
Is that his…

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44.200
You didn't turn off his phone? You didn't turn off his phone?

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46.160
It was in a foreign language.

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49.360
Fuck this shit, man. It's just getting worse and worse.

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51.400
It's okay, it's okay. This is fucked up.

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52.880
It's all right. What are you doing?

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54.000
Shush. I'm just…

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56.520
Fuck this shit.

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59.160
Easy. Uh…

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02.800
Excuse me, I'm just going to take the phone that's ringing, don't worry.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06.240
What are you doing? Don't answer. Stop it!

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07.800
Yes?

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11.720
I… I love you.

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm going to eat.

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16.600
Thanks. Thank you.

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21.960
It was the Norwegian Embassy.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24.200
The Norwegian Embassy? You didn't turn off his phone.

74
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26.320
They traced it. They know he's at the Élysée.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27.800
Goddamn it.  We're busted.

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29.240
What the fuck should we do now?

77
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32.600
Okay, first, you shut your mouth. Both of you, shut up.

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33.560
Second…

79
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38.040
don't talk about this to anyone.

80
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39.200
For sure.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43.120
Thirdly, I'll go talk to the Norwegians, try to calm them down.

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46.840
Thanks. I would have been bummed out to lose the job because of his bullshit!

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49.560
Let me explain. No matter what, you're both losing your jobs.

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50.840
That's for sure. What?

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53.000
The question is, how long will you serve in prison?

86
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54.520
Huh? That's inevitable.

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56.160
I predict 20 years for you, man. What?

88
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58.720
Yeah, you kind of look like a thug, makes people want to…

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00.720
You, since you're not that buff physically,

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02.960
they're gonna pity you and give you five years.

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04.760
Oh man. Five minimum.

92
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07.160
Two suspended and three Hopefully. That's a real downer.

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08.960
We'll hope for the best. Inshallah.

94
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11.480
Inshallah.

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14.320
All right.

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18.080
I'm going to put the phone back on the box, Mr. Norwegian.

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23.000
Stéphane.

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27.720
REPRESENT

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38.280
Yeah.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44.040
Do you have a minute? I want to talk to you about something real quick.

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46.200
I have a cabinet meeting, but go ahead. No problem.

102
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47.120
All right.

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50.560
I have an idea for a tax. Ah, it's about work?

104
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52.200
Of course it's about work.

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54.320
Ah. My idea is the Béké tax.

106
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55.640
Béké?

107
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58.120
Yeah. The Békés. The white landowners in the Antilles.

108
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59.240
Oh yeah.

109
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02.360
When slavery was abolished, the French government bought their slaves.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04.640
I don't know if you realize how much they make.

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07.120
They have distilleries, supermarkets and stuff. It's nuts.

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09.440
So what we're gonna do is impose a tax,

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12.640
then our money is returned and slave descendants are compensated.

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14.240
Awesome idea. You think so?

115
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15.640
Great idea. I'm glad you like it.

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16.960
I'd even add something too.

117
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19.520
As the first Black president of France, I'd have to go further.

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21.360
I must withdraw French troops from Africa.

119
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22.320
Yup. Yeah.

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24.520
Yup to all that. This is the end of colonialism.

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27.120
You got it. Excellent job. I'm impressed.

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29.480
And if you want, tonight we could talk about it oneonone?

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33.080
No.  Mr. President, can I talk to you?

124
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34.440
I'd like you to meet Aimé.

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35.600
Who's Aimé?

126
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37.920
He will be your wife's bodyguard from now on.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38.840
What?

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41.960
Why? I don't understand. I mean…

129
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43.480
How come you're making me do this?

130
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45.080
You're not listening. I don't want it.

131
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47.400
I said I didn't want a bodyguard. Why would I need one?

132
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49.760
Honey, we still haven't found all the terrorists,

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51.680
and I don't want anything to happen to you.

134
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52.840
Have him come in.

135
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55.040
God's sake. Here's Aimé.

136
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56.880
Mr. President.

137
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59.920
Morning.

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05.120
You know, she's capable of defending herself on her own.

139
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06.600
She's really strong…

140
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09.080
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Blé. At your service.

141
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11.080
Come on.

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26.200
What's the deal with Marion's bodyguard?

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27.200
Aimé?

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28.960
He's good, huh? But…

145
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31.200
You could have found someone who was less…

146
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33.840
I mean, more normal, you know? What do you mean, "normal"?

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37.000
Oh, don't even worry. He's 100% gay.

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38.120
Are you sure? Certain.

149
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39.680
I've seen it with my own eyes, so…

150
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43.160
Any news from William? William? The problem is, uh…

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44.240
William?

152
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47.640
No, I didn't say "William." I said "Wilhelm."

153
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48.560
Yeah.

154
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49.720
Who's that?

155
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52.960
He's a young Kabyle singer we're gonna to invite to the Élysée for Music Day.

156
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54.560
Oh yeah? He's a really great singer.

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55.760
What does he sing?

158
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00.680
Um…

159
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02.600
♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪

160
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13.000
♪ Boom, boom, boom ♪

161
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14.360
Then the beat goes like this and…

162
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16.080
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, yeah ♪

163
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17.920
You've fucked up. No!

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19.880
No.  Swear.

165
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21.400
Islam doesn't allow me to swear.

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23.400
Yeah. You're not even a Muslim.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26.320
It's a religion which I respect very much, that's why.

168
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27.240
Me too.

169
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30.640
Listen to me carefully, both of you. If I find out that you've fucked up…

170
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32.560
Everyone expects us to fuck up.

171
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35.080
We have to be beyond reproach until the legislative elections.

172
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37.400
Isn't it better to be beyond reproach after the elections?

173
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38.960
Mostly before.

174
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40.400
Calm down. I'm not kidding.

175
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42.560
I'm not kidding either, Yasmine. Calm down.

176
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44.720
Yeah, calm down. Seriously. Calm down.

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45.880
Man!  Unbelievable.

178
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48.360
The President of the French Republic.

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57.880
Salaam, shalom. Hello, everyone.

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00.360
Hi. Good morning, Mr. President.

181
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04.760
Patriarchal tardiness. Great start.

182
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06.160
Awesome. Thanks.

183
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09.520
Hello.  Hello.

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10.440
Hello.

185
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19.440
Antoine Journo, Mr. President.

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21.160
Our Minister of Sports.

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24.840
Like parasports, or…

188
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26.720
No, just sports.

189
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28.200
Okay.

190
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32.160
Uh. So, Corinne, I'm telling it to you straight.

191
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34.200
First I'll implement the "Eat well, for free" bill,

192
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35.560
then we can implement your bills.

193
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39.280
If I may, Mr. President, uh, your bill is somewhat out of budget.

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42.280
So if I have to pick, I pick the environmental transition.

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44.720
You can't do this to me. You told me it was within our budget.

196
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46.760
No. She's the one who told you that.

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50.160
Not me.

198
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52.040
When I said within our budget,

199
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55.480
it was, uh, with a growth projection of 3.2%.

200
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57.920
And right now, we're at 1.8%, so…

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59.720
I don't care about the 1.8%.

202
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01.960
I made a promise, and I intend to follow through

203
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03.280
and implement this bill.

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04.760
So let's fucking find the funds.

205
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09.520
We could abolish military nuclear spending.

206
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12.440
This is Clément Arenou, our secretary of defense.

207
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14.440
Just like the Bastille Day parade.

208
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15.440
It's pointless.

209
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17.120
Yeah, I'm totally with you on that one.

210
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19.560
I also think we should abolish the CFA franc.

211
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22.120
And let's pull out all those French troops from Africa.

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23.360
It would be my pleasure.

213
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25.600
I would disband the entire military if I could.

214
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29.280
Excellent. We should terminate military nuclear spending first,

215
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31.440
then civilian nuclear power while we're at it because…

216
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32.360
Whoa, whoa.

217
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36.400
I completely agree with the views expressed by everyone, right?

218
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38.880
We have a lot to do in the social realm, for the environment,

219
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40.360
education, justice, et cetera.

220
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43.080
But after the legislative elections.

221
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45.480
Because if we lose them, we won't do anything at all.

222
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48.840
So until then, sorry, but we're gonna make symbolic changes, and cheap changes.

223
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52.360
Come on, we can't just focus on the legislative elections.

224
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54.560
We have to get to work. It's important, in my opinion.

225
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56.560
You don't care, since you always lose elections.

226
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01.680
Oh wow. Okay, then.

227
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04.040
You all right? Hello.

228
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07.560
What's this guy doing?  Who's this?

229
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09.160
I got this.

230
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11.120
Stéphane?

231
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14.720
Uh, actually, he's here to help me handle a case in the West Indies.

232
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16.160
What case?

233
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22.160
Sorry. Excuse me, but the thing on your…

234
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23.600
Sorry.

235
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25.720
Why does she have a cauliflower on her head?

236
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27.760
Am I the only one seeing this?

237
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30.280
It's a Nigerian gele, not cauliflower.

238
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32.560
All right. Cultural appropriation. That's awesome.

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34.680
No, it's not cultural appropriation.

240
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36.760
It's the mark of support for the fight of women who…

241
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37.760
Hey, you!

242
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39.920
Yeah? Not interested in the fate of women?

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41.080
Yeah, bigtime. Yes.

244
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43.920
Uh, so I talked to the Norwegians. They sent him back to Norway.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46.920
It's all good. Uh, they won't say anything.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49.600
But in order to avoid a diplomatic incident,

247
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51.560
Norway demands that you meet with the queen.

248
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54.200
Do I have to? If you don't, you'll be locked up, man.

249
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57.240
So I guess there's no other way. Okay.

250
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59.440
Sorry. Uh, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00.360
Sorry.

252
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01.960
Really.  What are you doing?

253
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04.520
We have a press conference in ten minutes.

254
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07.120
Well, tell them we're inviting the Queen of Norway.

255
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08.960
Exactly. The Queen of Norway? Why?

256
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11.160
Have you lost it? Norway is a fossil fuel heaven.

257
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14.000
And don't get me started on the slaughter of whales in Greenland.

258
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18.320
And why do you think we're inviting her? Precisely to address all these concerns.

259
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19.640
Exactly. Yeah.

260
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22.600
Oh, the slaughter? Show her pictures. I have some on me.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24.880
I'll give them to you. I always have these pictures on me.

262
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27.880
I know. I have all the photos… No, wait. Mine are really illuminating.

263
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29.720
No, that's my notebook. Hold on, guys.

264
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31.280
Let's go. My menstrual cup.

265
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33.120
Hold on, hold on, that's…  Where

266
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34.080
What's that?

267
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35.640
My menstrual cup.

268
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37.360
To gather menstrual blood during my period.

269
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39.880
It's 100% more ecological than tampons.

270
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42.640
I don't understand, where do you put that? Do you put that in your…

271
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45.480
You think I put it where?

272
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48.000
It's in my bag because I'm not on my period, otherwise, sure.

273
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50.400
She still has her period.  Yes!

274
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52.480
Absolutely, I still have mine.

275
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55.880
Like 15 million French women, seven million have painful periods.

276
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57.160
Do you think that's fair?

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59.480
To have your period?

278
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00.640
No. Painful periods.

279
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04.080
Do you think it's right to go to work when you're in pain in a country like France?

280
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05.320
No! Well…

281
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08.040
It shouldn't be that way, so I'd like to talk about menstrual leave.

282
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09.360
What do you think? That's bold.

283
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11.600
Yes, I agree. Yeah. Of course, women agree.

284
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13.240
What do men think?  Yes.

285
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14.840
What do we think? Yes? Yeah.

286
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16.560
There.

287
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19.880
So let's put the menstrual leave on the agenda the next meeting, thanks.

288
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21.560
So, Mr. Cognard, what do you think

289
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23.760
of the first turmoil in the BléDouanier administration?

290
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24.840
FAR RIGHT SOON IN POWER

291
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26.800
According to reports, it's quite shaky right now.

292
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30.040
Of course it is, obviously. A thug and a lunatic wearing a hijab.

293
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31.080
A hijab! Dear Lord.

294
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33.840
At the higher reaches of the government. Nothing surprising there.

295
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37.120
Anyway, all this government wants is that our kids change sex or to become imams.

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39.120
Wait a minute, that's one big shortcut there.

297
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40.400
Not at all. Not at all.

298
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42.440
What do you think he means with this "France mleh"?

299
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44.400
My God. It means France halal, pretty much.

300
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47.440
And while real French people go hungry, what do they do?

301
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48.760
They invite a queen.

302
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50.000
But I have a message for them.

303
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52.000
The legislative elections are coming up,

304
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54.200
and the honkies are gonna fuck you over real deep.

305
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57.240
Oh my God. What a statement. Well, you are determined.

306
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00.120
So, real deep, I don't know, but in the electoral campaign,

307
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02.840
there seems to be an interesting dynamic at play.

308
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06.320
And if you win with the alliance of the rightwing and the far right,

309
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08.840
you have the potential to gain seats in the assembly.

310
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11.880
About time. About time. A kick in the balls by the blue boots.

311
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13.440
You mean just the one ball. The ball.

312
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22.480
This whole Queen of Norway thing is a disaster.

313
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24.720
We've lost four points in two hours.

314
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27.800
We should go back to lowincome neighborhoods, your base,

315
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29.440
and get young and old people to vote.

316
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31.080
Good morning.

317
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34.440
Sorry, do you know why I'm laughing? Because I see someone who is panicking.

318
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36.800
Stop panicking. Listen and learn.

319
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38.960
We're going to light a counterfire,

320
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41.280
to distract the attention and change the narrative.

321
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43.880
And it'll be solved. I'm telling you, it'll be resolved.

322
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45.800
Stop freaking out. Change the narrative?

323
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47.840
Without "Eat well, for free," we're screwed.

324
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49.000
"Change the narrative."

325
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51.040
No, I think we have to do a symbolic gesture,

326
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53.120
like change the name of the Place Charles de Gaulle.

327
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54.800
Wow! Ah!

328
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56.600
My ears hurt.

329
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59.840
Are you listening to yourself? It makes no sense.

330
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01.720
In France, there are things you can't touch.

331
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03.920
There are some constants. You can never touch de Gaulle.

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06.680
Hold on, guys, I don't want symbolic gestures, all right?

333
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08.800
I want to change French people's lives concretely.

334
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10.720
That's what I want. And for cheap.

335
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12.920
For cheap, yeah, I guess.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15.120
Yeah, that was the idea originally, wasn't it?

337
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17.360
So in that case… Mr. President.

338
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20.040
'Sup, Mr. Alain Feuillet?

339
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23.760
I'm sorry to disturb you, but you requested that I notify you

340
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25.840
if any complications arise with Lamine.

341
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28.400
And there's a big problem with Lamine.

342
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34.040
Oh, Black people. It's always the same thing.

343
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35.880
You want to help, and they get you in trouble.

344
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38.360
We don't even know what the problem is. It's always the same.

345
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40.360
He's very tardy. Oh yeah, always the same.

346
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42.880
He's not here now. You're right. It's always the same.

347
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44.760
It's just nuts, the whole…

348
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47.600
…CPT thing.

349
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51.560
They can't be on time. I'm mixed race, so I'm half on time, but…

350
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53.040
What are we eating for lunch? What?

351
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55.400
Tournedos Rossini. Yes! All right. That works.

352
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00.080
Bro, are you for real?

353
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03.080
You know what will happen if you don't finish your community service hours?

354
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05.200
Of course I know. Do you think I'm happy about it?

355
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07.240
The chef says you're late every morning.

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09.640
Am I late to work? It's easy for you. You live here.

357
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12.280
I don't see the point.

358
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14.960
Every day, I have a twohour commute back and forth.

359
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17.840
Metro 11's being renovated. The commuter rail sucks.

360
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21.600
I swear, Stéphane, it's not that I don't want to,

361
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23.640
but that's a twohour commute every day.

362
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25.280
Two hours.

363
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28.160
This whole equalityofopportunity thing or whatever is bullshit.

364
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33.680
Maybe we could have him live here.

365
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42.320
Hello? Yasmine?

366
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45.640
Yeah, call the press back. I have something to say.

367
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46.680
Not in the Élysée.

368
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49.600
Directly in the 'hood. You already know.

369
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54.240
Sorry, but if we do that, it's political suicide.

370
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56.160
The opposition will be on our asses.

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58.880
Not at all. I checked. We'll be able to pass it as an ordinance.

372
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00.960
It's not that expensive, and it's super popular.

373
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02.400
Not that expensive? It's not.

374
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04.280
French taxpayers are paying… Mr. President.

375
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05.840
Uh, it's really too risky.

376
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08.360
You have to keep it short with the terrorist threat against you.

377
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09.280
Quickly.

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11.640
What? What did she say? What are you doing?

379
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14.320
It's the Legion of Honor necklace. We're not at a WuTang concert.

380
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16.200
Take this off. I want to honor the people.

381
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18.760
Take it off, please. And the people, that's us.

382
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25.760
Today, I'm here to talk about housing. What do you see here?

383
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27.480
Go back to the Congo!

384
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28.520
Thank you, sir.

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30.160
I'm certain that on this street,

386
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32.480
there are dozens and dozens of unoccupied apartments.

387
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33.840
It's the same all over France.

388
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36.560
Just in Paris, over 100,000 apartments are empty.

389
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37.840
And we know that every morning,

390
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40.280
some people spend one to two hours in public transportation,

391
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41.360
to come to work.

392
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43.640
Whereas right next door to their job,

393
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46.320
there are unoccupied apartments due to speculation.

394
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48.440
You think that's okay? I personally don't.

395
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49.680
So from tomorrow onwards,

396
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51.680
I will be having conversations with mayors,

397
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53.520
unions, and local organizations

398
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56.200
so that people who need to, can live closer to their work.

399
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57.720
That's also the France mleh.

400
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00.520
And if the negotiations don't work, will you requisition them?

401
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02.520
Well, no. Of course we won't.

402
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04.360
Yeah, if we have to, I wouldn't mind. No.

403
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05.840
That's communism if you do that.

404
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08.960
Not at all, sir. It's called living together.

405
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12.480
It's also communism a little bit. A little bit of communism.

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15.680
I'll speak my mind, if that's okay with you.

407
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17.800
With your idea of living together,

408
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20.960
you're wide off the mark.

409
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24.360
Jeanette, you've got a nerve to tell me that,

410
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26.760
given you're always crashing at my place at the Élysée.

411
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29.560
This isn't your place here, son. It's the house of the people.

412
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32.400
Amen. What is he doing standing over there?

413
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34.000
Come eat with us, come on.

414
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36.080
Thank you, ma'am. I've already eaten.

415
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38.720
Ha! "Ma'am"?

416
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40.320
You can call me auntie, you know.

417
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42.640
I prefer to call you "ma'am." Ah, jeez.

418
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47.680
I like your "living together" idea. I think it's a good one.

419
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48.600
I like it.

420
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49.560
Thanks.

421
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51.840
It's a good idea, yes.

422
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53.960
But an enemy is going to stand in your way.

423
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55.520
Mmhmm. Yeah, I know.

424
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57.080
The Homeowners Union, all that.

425
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58.000
No.

426
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59.440
Belzebuth.

427
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00.640
Mmhmm.

428
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04.480
Every time someone wants to do something good,

429
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06.000
the devil makes sure it won't happen.

430
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09.720
But you will always be protected by the Lord, my son.

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11.440
Amen. Say "amen." Amen.

432
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12.680
Mm… Amen.

433
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16.840
Logically, every Black person should support you,

434
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18.000
but we don't stick together.

435
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22.320
That's why white people colonized us. No, come on Jeanette, you can't say that.

436
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24.040
Of course I can say it.

437
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27.800
Africa is where it's at right now because of Black people themselves.

438
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30.240
We have to stop saying it's white people's fault.

439
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33.920
No, no, Jeanette, that's enough. What? What will you do to me?

440
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36.360
Aren't you offended by what she's saying? Huh?

441
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41.480
All right, well, I have work to do, so…

442
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42.800
No, stay here. Come on.

443
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44.920
Wait, come on  See you.

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47.440
Meet you in the bedroom?  I don't think so.

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50.280
Mm!

446
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52.760
Hmm! That young woman is impolite.

447
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55.160
Did you see that?  I don't understand.

448
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56.720
What are you playing at?

449
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59.600
I'm trying to make up with her, and you're obstructing my efforts.

450
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02.880
Those girls from Zaire… She's not from Zaire, she's from Senegal.

451
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04.720
…they're the worst breed.

452
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15.240
On principle, we have nothing against "living together," Mr. President.

453
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18.280
But the owners I represent had to borrow money

454
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19.640
to pay for those apartments.

455
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22.240
They have mortgages to reimburse. They'd go broke.

456
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25.000
Perhaps we might offer them a small tax rebate?

457
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26.800
Or a big tax allowance would work?

458
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30.560
She's messing with you. Of course I'm messing with you.

459
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33.280
I mean, think about it for a second. This is what will happen.

460
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36.760
We're going to put the public interest ahead of your bourgeois selfinterest.

461
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40.000
Otherwise, we're going to requisition all empty apartments.

462
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42.200
And we'll do it, that clear? Wait. Come on, Corinne.

463
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43.960
Just calm down.

464
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45.120
Just please, calm

465
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48.560
That thing really suits you.

466
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50.080
For real.  Oh thanks.

467
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53.200
It's out of solidarity for my sisters going through chemotherapy.

468
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55.520
What, do you find cancer funny?

469
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58.000
Absolutely not. Cancer is the worst.

470
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00.040
And multiple sclerosis makes you laugh?

471
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02.640
No, no, it doesn't make me laugh.

472
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05.320
But I have to admit some diseases are funny. I'm being honest.

473
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08.360
But we're not here to talk about funny diseases, all right?

474
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10.480
We're here to talk about "living together."

475
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14.600
What can be done to help poor people live in highrent areas. Huh?

476
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16.000
That's all I want.

477
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18.720
Couldn't we work hand in hand for once, together,

478
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20.760
in the best interest of the public?

479
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22.400
And what will you cover?

480
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26.480
Huh?  Basically, you're imposing a policy

481
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28.120
that will cost the government nothing

482
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31.600
but put thousands in a shitty situation, and you want our solidarity?

483
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35.640
Hold on, what you're doing, sir, is oversimplifying my words.

484
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38.000
But yeah, it's true, that's what I'm asking, pretty much.

485
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39.760
Well, no, thanks.

486
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42.960
I'm sorry, but we must prioritize our interests.

487
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45.360
Believe me, all French people do as well. No.

488
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49.320
Wait, please, why don't we give this a try on a smaller scale?

489
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51.920
Perhaps somewhere near the Élysée, in Paris, or, uh…

490
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53.080
Mr. Mayor?

491
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57.320
Cousin, cut it out.

492
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00.080
You and me, we understand each other, don't we?

493
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01.160
Do you get me?

494
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04.520
Solidarity, sticking together. Black love.

495
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13.080
But, Mr. President, have you lost your mind?

496
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15.880
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

497
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18.040
But I want so much. I'm sorry.

498
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19.960
Let's be practical. What do you need?

499
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20.960
What is it you need?

500
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23.600
More public day cares in Paris? More nursing homes?

501
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27.120
No, I don't see why my voters should go through this, that's all.

502
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29.840
Hold on, Mr. Mayor of Paris.

503
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31.920
Don't you want to make history?

504
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34.840
Right? To be the first mayor of a large city

505
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37.200
to test this social, historical policy.

506
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40.960
In London, in Madrid, in New York, nobody else has done this feat.

507
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43.960
Do you realize the impact it'll have? The glory?

508
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45.800
History books will talk about you.

509
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48.760
Women will come ringing at your door, maybe, I don't know,

510
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50.160
to have sex with you, I guess.

511
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56.280
I'll think about it.

512
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59.680
All right. That's cool. So I suggest we try this at the Élysée.

513
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02.440
Let's have a garden party with both rich and poor people.

514
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05.720
White people, Black people, Jews, Asians, Muslims.

515
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08.960
Let's have a blast proving that living together is totally doable.

516
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11.960
There, that's what my next five years will be about.

517
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15.320
It'll be all about solidarity amongst all French people,

518
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16.880
to keep France as we love it.

519
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18.120
To make it mleh.

520
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23.280
Whoo!

521
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26.160
Whoohoo!  Yes!

522
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30.320
Today, I also would like to thank my lovely spouse, Marion,

523
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33.040
with whom I have gone through so much.

524
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35.200
But we've stayed super close anyway.

525
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38.000
Marion, you're a heck of a woman,

526
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40.280
and I should also say that you're pretty mleh.

527
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45.560
Congrats!

528
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47.360
Bravo!

529
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48.840
Thanks. Thank you all.

530
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50.200
Aren't I mleh?

531
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53.680
That's our son.

532
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08.040
Here, this is a summary of drilling in the Northern Sea and whale fishing.

533
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12.600
What, aren't you meeting with the Queen of Norway?

534
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15.400
Yeah.

535
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17.120
You're lying to me, aren't you?

536
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21.120
Okay, here's the truth.

537
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24.680
There's another reason. We have another issue.

538
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29.440
IKEA packages never have the right number of screws,

539
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30.840
and French people are fed up, man.

540
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33.840
Isn't it… Excuse me, but IKEA's Swedish.

541
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38.400
Right? Of course. It's Swedish.

542
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41.080
Exactly. That's the problem.  Mmhmm.

543
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42.480
French people should know that.

544
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43.840
Yeah.

545
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46.320
You need to come clean.

546
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47.960
What?  You're lying to me.

547
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50.200
What are you saying? You're something.  I am.

548
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52.120
Come on, can't you have a good time sometimes?

549
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55.280
Who says you can't enjoy yourself? Just have fun. Be like Marion.

550
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58.120
Oh yeah, she's having fun. She's definitely enjoying herself.

551
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04.760
Oh. I'm not worried at all. He's with the rainbow team.

552
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07.840
No, he's not. He's had flings with three women at the Élysée.

553
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09.760
They were all consensual, I checked.

554
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11.360
But he's hot to trot.

555
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15.560
You mean he isn't gay?

556
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17.320
Why would he be gay?

557
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21.280
Why did he come wearing a pink shirt to his interview if he isn't gay?

558
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23.480
I don't see your point.

559
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26.400
Claude! Claude, help! What the fuck? Uncle!

560
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27.720
Claude! Help! Please help me!

561
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29.120
Claude!  Dad?

562
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31.240
Stand aside, please. Make room, ma'am.

563
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33.400
Sir? Stay with us, sir. Dad? Dad?

564
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35.120
That's my father. Sir, stay with me.

565
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37.880
Can he hear me? I'm gonna give him mouthtomouth.

566
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39.800
Not a man. Damn it.

567
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41.120
Please, not a man.

568
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42.680
Not a man. What is he saying?

569
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45.240
It's because, you're Would you have a female colleague on hand?

570
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47.080
No, I don't have a female colleague.

571
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49.400
I'll give him mouthtomouth. Give him some space, please.

572
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53.200
I'll never get over it if a man puts his mouth on my mouth.

573
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54.680
Oh my God. That's nonsense.

574
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56.880
Don't worry, he's straight. You're straight, aren't you?

575
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58.760
Dad! Dad!

576
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01.920
I don't feel a pulse. We have to resuscitate him. Oxygen!

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04.200
Stop with your African crap! You're gonna die!

578
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06.920
We all agree, he's dying of homophobia, am I right?

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09.240
Dad, I beg you! I mean, he's homophobic and…

580
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11.920
Please, ladies and gentlemen, do not touch the buffet anymore.

581
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12.960
Step back!

582
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14.320
Did he eat something?

583
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15.680
He only drank champagne.

584
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25.200
Mr. President, I think he's been poisoned.

585
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27.160
Have you had any champagne?

586
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28.960
How are you feeling?

587
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30.480
You're dizzy, aren't you?

588
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36.320
Excuse me. Yeah, my bad, my bad. Sorry.

589
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38.760
So good. Holy shit!

590
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40.800
I had some too.

591
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43.280
Ma'am! Ma'am, I've had some too. Sorry, I've had some.

592
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44.560
Stéphane?

593
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46.640
