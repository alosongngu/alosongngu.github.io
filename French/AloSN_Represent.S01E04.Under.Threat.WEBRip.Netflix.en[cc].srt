00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08.680
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11.360
AMBULANCE

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14.080
Come on. Stay with us.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16.040
Stay with us. Stay with us. Is he gonna make it?

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18.560
Yeah. But, uh, please don't press…. He's bleeding out.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20.400
Hey, fucking hurry up! Shit!

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23.280
Oh, shit. This is my fault. Shit. I'm sorry.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27.040
What? All right, I don't understand.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29.200
He's trying to talk. Can you take this off?

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30.480
Huh?  My nuts!

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31.920
Your nuts? Oh, right. Fuck.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34.560
HOSPITAL

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42.200
All right, friends.  Well?

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44.280
The operation went well.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45.560
It was great. Great.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46.960
He's going to make it.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50.800
Longterm effects could happen, because… What else do you people need?

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53.120
A signed letter? Huh?

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56.280
"Yo, it's us, the Freemasons. We shot Stéphane Blé!"

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57.560
Yeah, he's right!

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01.480
Oh, no, man. No, shut your holes, you two. But they're both onto something, William.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03.840
Because coming to Corrèze without any kind of preparation

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05.040
is completely stupid, huh?

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06.960
Hey, it's Corrèze, all right?

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08.720
It's not like it's Right. Right.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11.840
I mean, the sponsors, now this. What about the sponsors?

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15.000
Uh, the sponsors are… It's nothing. Let's talk.

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17.840
You wanna speak, we'll speak. Yes.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21.880
Just us two. There's no reason to cause a scene in front of… the team.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23.520
But they can't know? Know what?

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26.760
Know that I checked three different times, and all our sponsorships are rightwing?

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29.760
And I was told you didn't want any extra security for this visit.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31.240
You're out to get Stéphane.

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33.720
Listen to me. This is what happens in politics.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37.840
You might have a future if you learn from me now. I'm a pro.

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39.120
Oh, no, no. No, thanks.

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41.080
What do you mean? Keep your offer of help.

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44.080
Mrs. Blé? Mrs. Blé?

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46.840
Please, make room.  Any news about Stéphane?

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48.600
Please, please. Can you step back?

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50.560
Do you believe the farright theory?

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51.880
Sir, please, just wait.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55.600
Today, a great blow was just struck at the core of democracy.

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58.320
As you know, Stéphane Blé is an adversary,

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59.880
but today,

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02.760
I'm here to visit a friend and a brother.

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06.360
A brother, which is why I went right away to get his mother and wife,

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07.640
so they can be with him too.

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14.520
What are your thoughts  Thank you.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18.080
You were his protector! What did you do? Where is he?

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21.920
Stéphane's all right? Go on, you can tell us.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24.440
He will recover. Oh.

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26.760
However, he took a bullet to the nuts.

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27.760
To the… What?

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28.880
To the testicles.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32.440
Oh, fuck. They both weren't hit. It's just the one.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34.760
A bullet tore open the testicle a bit.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37.360
They're sewing him back up now. They're professionals, so, uh…

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38.960
Marion, it's okay. It's all right.

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42.000
And, uh, unfortunately, we're not completely sure about the…

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45.480
Yeah, that…  What?

62
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47.400
Well, he'll be left as…

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48.840
You know, as a…

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51.920
He'll be a DJ? What?

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55.360
I'm not following. No, obviously not. He'll…

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57.360
His… Ah.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00.040
Psst. Lose the arm. But why would they…

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02.760
Because you're… No! That there are lasting effects.

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05.040
Ah! Lasting. That's "lasting effects"?

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06.480
Well, yeah.  Shh.

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07.440
That's absurd.

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09.800
The department head is a man I know personally.

73
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12.440
He'll get the best treatment. Trust me, he will.

74
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14.360
Shall we? Thank you.

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19.280
I bless you…

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21.040
…with the blood of our lord Jesus.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23.000
I pray to those who chain their foes.

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24.960
In the powerful blood of Jesus. Hey, hey!

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25.920
Say "amen"! Mom!

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27.000
Amen! Amen. Amen.

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29.360
God bless and protect my son.  Amen.

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31.480
Why'd you do this to us? Huh?

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36.480
Hmm. Excuse me.

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40.200
Hello, Stéphane. Let's go, Simone.

85
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43.680
Let's let them talk. Let's let them talk.

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45.680
God, protect my son. That's good.

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47.240
Amen!

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52.160
You scared us a bit, Stéphane, you know?

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54.080
I want you to know, I will do my utmost

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56.240
to make sure this crime doesn't go unpunished.

91
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58.080
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00.520
Anyway, you're alive, thank God!

93
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04.160
And your testicle is saved.

94
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07.120
If the testicle's still here, it seems it's all thanks to you.

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10.440
You, who work in the shadows, who, despite derision, fatigue,

96
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12.680
and, uh, more cutbacks to your budgets,

97
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15.760
continue to give your lives in order to save the lives of others.

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18.600
So I will say this to you directly. Bravo to you.

99
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21.920
You're the last rampart against the barbarity of men.

100
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25.800
No, no. You're the ones who deserve the applause here.

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30.920
You fucking bastard.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32.680
I think my friend is speaking to me.

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34.600
What is it?  You fucking bastard.

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36.920
Yes, of course, they can bring you custard, my friend.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39.880
Whatever you want. Mmhmm.  I'll fuck your mom.

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43.280
I'll fuck your mom.

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47.480
Ah, he's desperate for his mother. Let's just leave him to rest.

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49.000
All right, I

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51.520
Oh, dear. The pain is too great.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54.520
Let's go, let's go. We shouldn't stay. Oh, dear.

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57.360
I'll be around, Stéphane. Stay strong, my brother.

112
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02.640
Ah. He's a fighter, our Stéphane, huh?

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11.880
Yes? You went a little overboard here.

114
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15.280
Yeah, I said to hit him hard, true, but not like this.

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17.280
Yeah, but now we're… we're all set.

116
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21.480
Yeah, your perspective is right. Okay.

117
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23.200
Still, I've got bad news.

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27.360
Um. You won't be able to join my team. I can't take you now, you understand?

119
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30.320
It might look opportunistic. It's a bad look.

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32.760
Excuse me? You must see, given this situation

121
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34.640
But I Why? I'm not There's no

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36.960
He had an accident. Big whoop. I mean, II…

123
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39.200
It's not really ju likelike I'm switching sides.

124
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41.680
You know, I'm joining a campaign that'sthat's successful.

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43.560
And you And you have to No, I don't, man.

126
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45.960
Please, please, please, don't do this. Please, don't.

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47.880
Unbelievable. You're You're pathetic.

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48.800
It's Huh?

129
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50.440
That moron and you are a great match.

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51.920
Is that right? Yeah, that's right.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54.080
His ball's gone, and you never had any.

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56.680
Yeah, well, you know what?

133
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57.800
In terms of nuts…

134
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59.720
you, my friend…

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01.960
Hmm? I'll tell you what…

136
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03.440
What? Well, let me finish.

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06.120
What? Nothing. You know that, man.

138
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08.720
You It's just Look at you.

139
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11.280
Yeah, yeah. Look at you, look at me.

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15.240
France Info,

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17.800
and we're here with an update on candidate Stéphane Blé,

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20.040
whose life is no longer in any danger.

143
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21.400
Aside from his right testicle,

144
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23.560
there were no other injuries to vital organs,

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26.760
caused by this radicalized extremist, who, and I quote here,

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28.960
was "sick of having these Blacks busting his balls

147
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30.160
in his beautiful Corrèze."

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32.480
You're a very fortunate man, Mr. Blé.

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35.240
Five millimeters away from becoming Mrs. Blé.

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42.680
I'm not laughing. Ah, you just can't make jokes.

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46.040
I have to donate sperm in a little while. Is that doable?

152
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48.240
Could be, but until then, you have to rest,

153
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50.680
as a pellet may move and IVF will be futile.

154
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55.360
All right. Have a nice day, everyone.

155
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00.720
Uh, well, we're doing pretty well, aren't we?

156
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02.600
Right?

157
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07.960
I've been thinking, and, uh…

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14.240
I could be the donor in his place. Oh, shut up. Seriously, Mo.

159
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16.360
No, but it's pretty easy. It's just Just stop it!

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19.840
Oh, no. Hey, Mo, I'm fasting today. Why are you doing this to me right now?

161
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22.800
I'm saying, I can do it myself.  Don't touch yourself.

162
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25.120
Stop looking at me. I'll stop my campaign.

163
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27.160
What's that? I'll stop my campaign.

164
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29.200
Could you all step out? No, that's not possible.

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31.360
Stéphane Can you leave? I need to talk to Marion.

166
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33.640
Please, just think about it.

167
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35.680
He'sHe's clearly in shock. Okay?

168
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38.200
We'll talk later. We'll talk, Stéphane. All right.

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40.000
We'll talk.  Why won't they use me?

170
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42.800
Because then, biologically, the child wouldn't be Stéphane's.

171
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44.120
We're both African.

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48.160
You're sure?

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50.200
Certain.

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05.160
And since I know it's gonna be a girl,

175
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08.840
I'm sure that our Mariam will end up president of the Republic.

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09.960
Christiane, we decided.

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13.720
Why would I give my daughter a crazy old lady name like that?

178
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16.360
What's up with that? Taubira, bish.

179
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18.240
Christiane Taubira. Are you kidding me?

180
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19.920
Oh, yeah, that's right. My bad.

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27.440
Etienne, how are you?  Fine. How's Blé?

182
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28.960
Uh, well, listen… Pfft.

183
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31.440
He's fine. Yes.  That's good.

184
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33.080
Yes, of course, it's good. Wow.

185
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36.280
So, I was thinking, I'm available now. Mmhmm. Right.

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40.360
Uh, maybe you guys have a role for me? You know, special tasks or…

187
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42.080
Oh, no, no, no.  Huh?

188
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44.640
That's impossible. It'd be opportunistic.

189
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47.400
Okay, that's fine, man. Well, okay.

190
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49.680
Good luck. Take care. Thanks anyway.

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51.120
Fuck me.

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54.200
Three days from the first round of votes in the presidential election.

193
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57.240
Rightwing candidate Durandeau is still lagging behind.

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00.200
He's been overtaken by the farright candidate Fred Cognard.

195
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04.080
And Corinne Douanier is also struggling as the deadline approaches.

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07.080
But with Stéphane Blé's campaign at an abrupt end,

197
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08.880
Éric Andréï has really taken off,

198
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12.000
and is now showing at 29 percent, topping the polls.

199
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18.800
Hey, Stéph, how are you? What's up, girlfriends?

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21.520
I'll be of age in five years. Campaign again, I'll vote for you.

201
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24.000
Hey, power to you. Power. Thanks, girls. Thank you.

202
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26.200
For real, I feel kinda bad for him.

203
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29.160
Well, we've got good news, Mr. Blé.

204
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32.320
All the pellets have fallen to the bottom of the scrotum.

205
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35.160
We can proceed with the sample. Wait, um, I've got a question.

206
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37.480
Won't it be kind of painful if I start tugging on myself?

207
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38.960
With my injury and all. No.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42.200
No, but because of the buckshot, it could cause tinkling sounds.

209
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46.000
And I think if you try to follow a rhythm, you could do "Jingle Bells."

210
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51.480
Of course not. Fill to the mark. You remembered the three abstinence days?

211
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53.680
Yeah, we abstained. Ah.

212
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56.000
Yeah, for real.

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57.400
I mean, you wouldn't

214
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59.000
You finished? You finished?

215
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00.680
It's just that Because of my injury.

216
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02.280
So the rhythm, the pace… Uhhuh.

217
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04.040
…it's all just a little mismatched.

218
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07.240
But when things are normal, I mean, then it's great.

219
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08.640
Really, I'm not trying to brag.

220
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11.080
No. But it really is. It's…

221
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12.080
This thing, it's…

222
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13.520
Yes? Hmm?

223
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16.320
It's? Uh, nothing.

224
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17.280
Good.

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19.000
Well, you can follow me, ma'am.

226
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27.920
What are you doing, Mr. Blé?

227
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30.840
Well, you set down the little cup.

228
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33.360
There's a special room for that. Please. A nurse will take you.

229
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35.840
Oh, okay. All right. Not in my office. Of course not.

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40.840
All right.

231
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41.840
You've got…

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44.360
the magazines right over here.

233
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47.800
And videos… here.

234
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52.440
And if there's something else you need, I'm right outside, just give me a call.

235
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55.880
No, no, it's fine, yeah. The magazines and the TV are good enough, thanks.

236
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01.200
Have a nice day.

237
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12.040
Whoa!

238
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26.000
Bravo!

239
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28.160
Bravo!

240
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33.160
Andréï for president! Andréï for president!

241
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35.680
Andréï for president! Andréï…

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38.320
Since the assassination attempt on Stéphane Blé,

243
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39.840
the campaign has resumed its course.

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40.920
One week from the vote,

245
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43.960
it's likely the second round will be Andréï and Cognard.

246
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47.080
Today, the subject of colonization became the hot topic,

247
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49.840
on the 60th anniversary of the truce in Algeria.

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51.760
Both candidates had their reactions.

249
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55.320
At some point, we have to stop being made to feel guilty over colonization.

250
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58.200
The real colonization is the one the French are experiencing every day.

251
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00.920
Hijabs in schools, halal butcher shops…

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02.800
With the Fatimas, the Mohammeds.

253
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04.920
This colonization, once I'm elected to lead,

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05.840
it'll be over.

255
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08.600
Everyone on a charter, on a flight, straight to the Casbah. Hmm?

256
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10.240
Can we change the channel?

257
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12.280
Mr. Andréï, your reaction to this?

258
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15.200
There's a report on ants that I've been waiting to see now.

259
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16.840
So?

260
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18.120
Ah, yes, colonization.

261
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20.680
It's a topic we must approach with a lot of responsibility.

262
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23.080
In many ways, we are unjust.

263
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24.960
But may we not consider that…

264
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27.560
that colonization has also had some benefits?

265
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30.560
Ugh.  …regarding hygiene, uh, or forks.

266
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33.640
Whether it's transport, the railway…  Oh, man.

267
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36.040
…between Djibouti and Addis Ababa.

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40.400
That's huge. And bridges. Right? All Africans love bridges.

269
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42.560
So, you see, colonization, sure.

270
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45.000
We also need to look beyond that and tell ourselves….

271
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58.120
♪ Back to the future… future… ♪

272
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07.160
STÉPHANE BLÉ HE'S GOT NO BALLS

273
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28.560
That's exactly it, man. That's what I keep trying to tell him.

274
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30.800
Shit.  What are you guys doing here?

275
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32.840
Oh, Mr. President. Come on, chill. Have a seat.

276
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34.280
Guys, it's late. Get home!

277
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37.800
I'm taking you guys home. Let's go.

278
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40.520
No. Mom left the keys in the door. I can't. You know what she's like.

279
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42.840
Let's go. I'll get her to answer Hey!

280
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46.160
Don't pretend you're my dad, Stéphane! Just stop acting like my dad, all right?

281
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48.160
You've got Marion. You're gonna have a family.

282
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49.560
That's great for you!

283
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52.520
Me, I'm making it on my own. But, sure, I'm all right.

284
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55.080
What do you mean? I'm here. I'm not letting you down.

285
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57.000
Come on, level with me. You quit your campaign?

286
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59.520
Of course you're letting us down. You just quit on us!

287
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00.640
That's the thing!

288
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03.400
Now you're out, we're supposed to vote for who, huh?

289
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05.880
Who you voting for, Stéphane? Voting for what?

290
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07.600
The fascist or the bully?

291
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09.040
Use your head for once!

292
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11.600
Just use your head, for fuck's sake!

293
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15.000
You get people's hopes up, then leave 'em in shit.

294
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17.040
That's easy, huh? That shit is so easy!

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24.320
A FRANCE FOR ALL REAL SOLUTIONS COME FROM BELOW

296
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46.200
What's up with you?

297
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48.920
I'm restarting the campaign.

298
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54.360
No.

299
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57.320
But what about the IVF? The injection is in three days.

300
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58.480
Don't worry.

301
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04.720
Honey…

302
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06.880
I can't just let everyone down like that.

303
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10.400
Honey!

304
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12.080
And if I say no?

305
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14.120
Well, that's serving the extreme right.

306
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24.400
And the IVF? Don't worry. I got this.

307
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31.280
Hmm…

308
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38.680
Mandela and Winnie?

309
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42.960
Better. Amadou &amp; Mariam.

310
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45.000
We can't see, but we walk together.

311
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47.640
Because they're blind, so, you know…

312
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49.960
Yeah, I know who Amadou &amp; Mariam are.

313
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54.920
You're always doing that!

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56.520
Goodness! Just stop!

315
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57.960
Are you Malian? No.

316
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01.200
Knock it off then. It's not even funny. Yeah, sorry.

317
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04.520
Stop making fun of them all the time. You're done. It's like, whoa.

318
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05.440
Sorry.

319
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08.080
You scared me. Stop it.

320
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09.680
Okay, love you. Yeah.

321
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22.920
Hey.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24.640
Are we back in the game or what?

323
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32.040
Quitting was a mistake, but I'm here now, and I'm excited.

324
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33.680
Any news on William?

325
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35.240
He hasn't been responding. He's gone.

326
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38.560
We don't need him anyway right now. I'll be in charge of the campaign.

327
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39.720
Okay.

328
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41.760
And where are we at in the polls today?

329
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44.800
Low. Really low. Tied with Corinne the Green.

330
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51.480
Okay. We can't do any worse than that. We've got a few days left. Let's hustle.

331
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53.360
What? Of course I sent out my résumé.

332
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54.480
No one's responding…

333
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00.840
Guys, the reason I came back is also this little bastard here.

334
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02.680
Now that he's here, let's get to work.

335
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05.120
Okay. There's lots of work for us to do.

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07.640
That's right. Tonight, 5:00 p.m., Stéphane Blé on Instagram.

337
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10.680
We need all our contacts on every social media platform.

338
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13.080
Why Stéphane Blé? Because he's the Hello. Stéphane Blé.

339
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15.080
Thank you very much. April 10th. Stéphane Blé.

340
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17.120
Vote for Blé.  We reach out to people.

341
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18.760
We need to reach wide. Stéphane Blé.

342
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21.080
We reach out to the voters on their own turf.

343
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22.320
It's 60? Yeah.

344
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27.400
And vote Blé.  We have a lot to say.

345
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30.240
We need to be heard. Unheard of. Doin' free school lunches.

346
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32.200
I know you guys are starvin'. You're starving.

347
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33.600
Anyway, it's our last chance.

348
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38.200
And before the end, I promise, we'll hit 'em hard, and they'll feel it.

349
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41.120
Yeah.

350
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43.600
The reason I'm ending my campaign right here…

351
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46.400
is because, right here, we've got problems.

352
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48.720
Hmm?

353
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51.960
And also the solutions.

354
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52.880
Ah.

355
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54.600
I wanna love the police.

356
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57.400
I wanna trust them and feel the police will protect us.

357
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59.640
When I see the police here…

358
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02.280
I hope I can run to our officers.

359
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04.400
To embrace. Huh?

360
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06.080
We need to trust each other.

361
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08.080
We need to stop suspecting each other. Sorry.

362
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10.440
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

363
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11.960
Uh… Yeah.

364
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14.080
Thank you. Excuse me.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17.400
Sorry, sorry. It's because I wasn't feeling well.

366
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19.640
But I'm better now and with you till the end. Sorry.

367
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21.680
Go on. Go on.

368
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25.520
You know…

369
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28.680
…I'm not a big drinker, and recently, I overdid it.

370
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31.200
Oh, no. I was pretty out of it for a sec.

371
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33.720
Ooh.

372
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36.240
While I was out of it, I saw things.

373
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38.240
Some crazy things,

374
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40.200
like my mom getting to sleep through the night,

375
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41.600
without kids below her window

376
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44.480
always listening to Niska or arguing the whole night.

377
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48.040
While I was out of it, I saw sisters able to walk down the street, unafraid,

378
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50.960
in leggings, or a hijab, and no one gave a crap.

379
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52.520
A skirt, even. A skirt.

380
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54.960
Short skirts with heels, or maybe boots

381
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57.760
In my vision, young men and women walked with their heads high,

382
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01.120
without worrying about ID checks or about getting turned down for a job

383
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03.840
because they don't look right or don't live in the right area.

384
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08.920
In my vision, my homeland, our France, live united, reconciled,

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11.680
able to look in the mirror and tell her children,

386
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12.960
all her children,

387
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14.120
"Your home is here."

388
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21.080
Liberty, equality, brotherhood.

389
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24.160
And security!

390
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25.160
Hmm?

391
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29.720
Right. Security too. You're right.  Thank you.

392
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35.040
Yeah, that sounds good. "Liberty, equality, security."

393
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38.400
Yes!

394
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39.520
Whoo!

395
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42.760
Bravo!

396
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44.680
Long live your vision!

397
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47.280
Long live your vision!

398
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55.160
I knew he wasn't more leftwing than me.

399
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58.040
Because he's Black. That means nothing, "because he's Black."

400
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00.200
I'm leftwing to the bone. So?

401
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05.560
Is the prefecture deal mine or what? Who cares?

402
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07.000
What's that mean, "who cares"?

403
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10.840
Listen to me. To hell with the prefecture.

404
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14.680
I'm worried about your cousin. You know what he's saying out there?

405
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16.320
"Liberty, equality…"

406
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18.680
And? "Security." Security!

407
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21.560
All right? This moron's turning rightwing.

408
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24.520
And nobody cares. He's taking eight percent from me.

409
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26.800
He's stealing. So, we need to react.

410
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30.560
Security, all right. I say Lamine.

411
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31.960
What, Lamine?

412
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34.480
The boy, Lamine. He works with him. So what?

413
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37.280
Ah, well, "security" equals "Lamine."

414
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39.400
Yeah, but he's a boy. Lamine's just feeling lost.

415
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41.720
But he's not a thug. He's just a boy, yeah?

416
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45.240
Yeah. He's still a delinquent.

417
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49.600
We'll arrest the kid together.

418
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58.360
Hey, totally. I don't even know. You can believe me or not, okay?

419
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00.800
Okay, my buddy's here. Call you back. Lamine, my man!

420
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03.360
What's up? How's it going? You good? What's up?

421
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04.480
You, how's it going?

422
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08.200
Lamine, there's about thirty thou here.

423
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12.280
You mean Désiré wants to help our campaign?

424
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14.200
Stéphane is family. You know that.

425
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15.360
Of course we'll help.

426
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20.480
Seriously, you don't trust us? No, just checkin', aye.

427
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24.240
Hey, come on. What's all this? Hey.

428
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25.520
Calm down. I don't want this.

429
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28.200
Same as cash. You just need to sell it. I don't want it!

430
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30.200
Are you serious? I don't want it!

431
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35.240
Nobody move! Nobody move! I said don't move!

432
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37.440
Don't move!  Stop right there!

433
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38.560
Stop running!

434
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59.840
Yeah, Marion? It's Lamine.

435
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02.280
Yeah, I fucked myself here. I need help.

436
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05.360
No, I can't be on France Info. I told you, man. I can't.

437
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08.080
I'm at the clinic, waiting for Marion, for the IVF right now.

438
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10.760
It's just not possible. It's happening today, man.

439
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13.160
Yeah. See you, William. Bye.

440
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17.000
Your wife still hasn't come? No, she's pretty late. I don't get it.

441
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19.520
She's someone who's early. I'm just as confused.

442
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23.440
At worst, uh,

443
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25.920
can we maybe put the embryo in some kind of fridge?

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27.200
Like, because it's an egg?

445
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29.360
Twentyfour, fortyeight hours maybe, like…

446
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31.440
Well Well, no.

447
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35.040
You can't just… The process won't work that way.

448
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37.280
It's now or never, at the moment.

449
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42.240
Ah.

450
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44.680
Hello? Where are you?  Stéph?

451
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47.240
Come to the Boulevard Hotel. We've got a major problem.

452
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50.000
Please, please, hurry. Hurry! Okay, I'm coming.

453
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52.800
See you soon. Stay there, all right? Stay there.

454
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55.520
So sorry. I have to go.  Oh.

455
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57.960
Really, so sorry. Sorry.  That's all right.

456
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13.520
Yes?

457
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16.360
It's me.

458
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20.680
You okay? What happened? No, no, I'm not okay. Oh, Stéphane.

459
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22.040
See there's…

460
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26.240
Those boys, Désiré, Lotfi, those guys tried to trick Lamine.

461
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28.840
They say, "Yeah, we'll give you some money for the campaign,"

462
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30.200
when it was actually pot.

463
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31.880
Stéphane, I fought Lotfi.

464
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36.080
It's just, I hit him. He took a bad fall. Bad.

465
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38.480
That was when the police got there. They were waiting for us.

466
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44.360
WILLIAM: TURN ON THE NEWS!!!

467
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46.360
A bombshell has been dropped

468
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48.920
squarely in the middle of the presidential election.

469
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50.920
The hackers, probably from Russia,

470
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54.240
reportedly had an accomplice inside one of the campaign teams

471
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56.480
and exposed emails of the candidates.

472
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00.240
On both the right and the left, many staff members are in a panic.

473
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02.320
Any comments on the millions embezzled?

474
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05.160
No, no, no. No comment, please. No comment, please.

475
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07.760
Where do you think this was leaked from, Mr. Andréï?

476
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11.080
Oh, this is crazy. Oh, this is insane.

477
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13.200
Are you going to end your campaign?

478
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15.560
We received an official press release just now,

479
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17.600
with the campaign committee for Éric Andréï

480
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20.680
attesting to the withdrawal of the candidate at this time.

481
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22.000
I repeat…

482
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25.920
Éric Andréï is no longer a candidate in the presidential election.

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30.120
But the frontrunner in the polls is not the only victim of this recent data leak.

484
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34.040
Another scandal has seemingly bombed the candidacy of Etienne Durandeau.

485
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37.040
Mr. Durandeau…

486
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39.480
Listen, I don't comment on foolish rumors.

487
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43.120
The rightwing candidate is at great risk of accusations of high treason,

488
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45.240
and his immediate withdrawal as a candidate

489
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47.240
was also just recently announced.

490
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49.520
The latest candidate to be affected by these leaks

491
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51.600
and forced to rapidly terminate his campaign,

492
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54.600
leader of the "blue boots" extreme right, Fred Cognard.

493
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57.240
Mr. Cognard, can you  Get the hell back!

494
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00.080
Were other animals involved? Hey! The dog consented!

495
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01.360
The dog consented!

496
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03.680
No complaints are currently filed against Cognard,

497
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07.000
but there are several compromising videos seemingly showing Cognard with a dog

498
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10.400
that have already gotten tens of millions of views online.

499
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13.160
Only two of the main campaigns appear to be unaltered

500
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14.840
by this embarrassing cataclysm.

501
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17.680
That of Stéphane Blé, in complete disarray right now,

502
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19.200
and that of Corrine Douanier,

503
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21.720
who chose not to use emails in her campaign

504
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23.560
in order to reduce her carbon footprint.

505
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27.040
As the campaign is ending, Blé and Douanier may well be the opponents

506
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30.040
in the second round of the swiftly approaching election.

507
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33.720
Tonight, our guests will be analyzing this truly astonishing case in our his

508
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38.960
Stéphane, you'll get to the second round. Turn myself in, it's over.

509
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51.560
We'll make a choice…

510
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55.040
for you to take off on the run.

511
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58.440
Are you serious? Just until the second round.

512
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00.760
You'll disappear to Normandy, where Nora's mother is.

513
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03.360
Mo'll watch your back. I'll say Lamine got an internship.

514
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05.000
You're resting for IVF. Let's do it.

515
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07.120
Are you crazy? Just stop. We're not doing that.

516
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09.840
Have you lost your mind? Go on the run?

517
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11.880
But this It's crazy!

518
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14.400
Turning ourselves in at least gives us a chance.

519
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18.520
Otherwise, we're fleeing. They won't go easy on you then.

520
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20.200
No. Wait, Stéphane. Stop this right now.

521
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22.440
We are in the second round.  No. No!

522
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25.280
If he turns himself in, I have to leave the campaign.

523
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27.240
No. No, but Stéphane isn't doing this.

524
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28.840
It's me. I decided. Let's go.

525
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30.760
No, wait. I'm stuck now with no choice!

526
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32.320
Lamine! There's no choice, Marion!

527
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34.760
Hey, Stéphane, are you serious right now?

528
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39.640
Yeah, Mo. Yeah, it's Lamine. Yeah, I'm with Marion now.

529
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43.200
Listen, you need to pick us up right now. We're at the hotel behind the national.

530
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47.400
No, are you stupid? Not the soccer team, the national highway.

531
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49.600
Mo, it's an emergency!

532
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59.480
It's 7:59 p.m.,

533
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02.920
and the faces of the two candidates for the second vote

534
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04.800
will be revealed to all.

535
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06.400

536
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09.480
…three, two, one.

537
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15.120
Stéphane Blé and Corinne Douanier…

538
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18.320
…will move on to the second round of the presidential election.

539
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21.000
Stéphane Blé, local monitor until a few weeks ago

540
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22.160
when his campaign launched…

541
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25.120
You hear me? You're gonna win it! You'll win it!

…face off in the second round of the presidential election.

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38.520
or else, its very first female president.
