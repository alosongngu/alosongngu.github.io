00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08.600
OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17.240
Women and men of France. My fellow citizens.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21.520
As of today, I am stepping down from my role as president

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23.600
with a profound sense of sorrow.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28.000
I must admit that I would have gladly served a third term,

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30.600
but apparently, doing so isn't "democratic."

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31.680
Whatever.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36.480
So, during my terms, did I succeed at everything?

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37.480
No.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40.760
Have I made blunders? Yes.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46.600
The extramarital affair with Magalie was a regrettable misunderstanding.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48.960
Did I lie to you?

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52.480
Yes. Yes, I did.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55.800
But isn't it more important in the end that I admitted everything

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59.440
when Magalie presented to the press the evidence she had kept?

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02.080
My fellow citizens,

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05.400
I would like to conclude with a message of fraternity.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10.840
Not all of France's problems can be attributed solely to immigrants.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12.040
Not always, anyway.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16.400
Some of them are even a blessing for our country,

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19.920
just like my successor, our new president, Stéphane Blé.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21.920
Yes, he's French. Indeed.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25.200
But he's Black, and I'm happy about it.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28.680
He's reliable and honest.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29.960
Vibrant.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34.240
And I know that he'll be able to bring to the top of the state,

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36.240
tropical goodheartedness.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44.720
I'll be president for white people, Black people.

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46.160
I'll be president for hobos,

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50.520
for women, for women who wear hijabs, for thugs, dwarves, redheads.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52.600
I'll be a free president, one who never gives up.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54.840
I won't neglect anyone.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58.520
Not in cities, not in the countryside, not in overseas French territories.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02.040
And I'll implement my key measure, "Eat well, for free."

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04.680
Long live France. Long live the republic.

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06.960
Salaam, shalom, see ya.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09.520
All together. All together.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11.000
Yes.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14.600
["À Nous la Victoire" by Pit Baccardi playing]

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28.400
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40.280
I thought I was the first Black person in the Élysée.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43.480
Isn't it tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, it's tomorrow, auntie.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45.200
We just came to rehearse a little bit.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47.200
I'm Stéphane Blé, French president.  Ah.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48.920
I'm Sorona. Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50.640
Nice to meet you, auntie.

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53.640
Morning, all.

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55.200
Mr. President. Hello.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57.040
Now that I'm your head of security detail…

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58.720
Co. Co.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01.080
Pardon me? Cohead, ma'am.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05.480
Right. Uh, I must insist, we have to speed things up.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06.800
The inauguration is approaching,

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09.480
and we're not there yet in terms of safety.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12.480
But I think it's most important for you to take time to work on your speech.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14.720
I've written a first draft. Here it is.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16.640
Yasmine, can I talk to you for a minute?

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19.320
Uh, but…

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20.560
Just to let you know,

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23.080
I'm not a big fan of drafts, you know what I mean?

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25.640
I'm a firm believer in the power of hiphop.

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28.720
I feel like if I show up at the ceremony and unleash some freestyles,

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31.160
I guarantee you the crowd will absolutely eat it up.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33.080
Oh no. No. It might just go down in history.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36.440
No improv, no freestyling. You'll make a speech that's been written.

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38.120
And I'd like to add, make it short.

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40.440
The less you expose yourself, the better.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43.080
After all these threats we've received, we can't take any risks.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45.760
White supremacists? Yes.

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48.080
But not only. Uh, yeah, mostly.

71
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51.720
But there are also the Salafists, the survivalists, the royalists,

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53.400
and the animalists.

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55.600
Anyway, it's coming from all sides like never before.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58.440
Well, you're used to it, aren't you? It's no problem.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01.520
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03.320
Thing is, when you were elected,

77
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07.720
the previous head of security department, he called it quits.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10.480
And his assistant as well. The whole team quit.

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14.240
You're brandnew to this, basically. Yes. Just like you guys.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17.280
We're all going to learn together. We're all going to die together, rather.

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19.160
Stéphane, I already told you, I need a weapon.

82
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20.720
Forget about it. No. No way.

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24.080
No gun without a license. We just received this for the president.

84
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26.280
It's just been cleared by the bomb squad.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33.760
It's a banana.

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38.640
There's something inside.  What the…

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41.520
Ooh, they went through a lot of trouble.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50.240
"Go back to Congo now, to eat bananas and sing with La Compagnie Créole,

89
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51.520
you filthy monkey."

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55.320
"Ohohoh. Ahahah. Ohohoh. Ahahah."

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57.200
"Ohah. Oh."

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59.320
"Ohah." So those are monkey screeches.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01.120
Oh yeah, you're right.

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03.640
So, it seems very clear to me, Mr. President.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05.480
I think this is a threat against you.

96
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07.200
Because oftentimes,

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09.960
people make comparisons between Black people and monkeys.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11.680
I mean, wrongfully so. What's she saying?

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15.200
We could also do a presidential inauguration online, on Zoom.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18.440
No, no, no. We're from the 'hood. We're not afraid of anyone, all right?

101
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21.640
This inauguration, we're gonna do it up close and personal, and with strength.

102
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24.280
Plus, these guys are amateurs. Oh yeah? Why is that?

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27.360
Why is that? Yeah, well, the Compagnie Créole and Congo?

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30.200
Totally unrelated. It's all good, we got it. No problem.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33.720
REPRESENT

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41.640
Stéphane Blé, or President Blé, will move into the Élysée in 24 hours.

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42.840
IS PRESIDENT BLÉ LEGITIMATE?

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45.560
What is for certain is that it's a big jump into the unknown.

109
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48.240
Well, let's hope for his sake it won't be a jump into the void,

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50.480
as his "Eat well, for free" project.

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53.160
It's all nice and good, but it's impossible to finance.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54.760
Yes. What is his agenda?

113
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55.760
The answer's elusive.

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58.000
For sure. At the next legislative elections,

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00.760
we know how politics work, he's gonna get crushed, destroyed.

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01.720
That's for sure.

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04.520
He was elected, though, despite a recordhigh abstention rate.

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07.600
He has less than two months to become the president, and most importantly,

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09.520
to convince the French people.

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12.280
Quick, quick. We won, we should be able to enjoy a bit.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13.320
We didn't win.

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15.360
Without an assembly majority, we can't do anything,

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17.440
which means forget your "Eat well, for free" measure.

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20.160
No way. That's the top priority on my todo list, believe me.

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23.400
I agree. So we don't have a choice. We have to find support.

126
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26.360
A real leftwing prime minister with a real political party.

127
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28.520
There aren't that many options. Either Andréï…

128
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30.080
Hey, have you lost your mind?

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32.240
He's been up shit's creek lately, to put it mildly.

130
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34.560
Never. Not a chance.  We agree on that.

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37.160
Good. So it'll be Corinne Douanier.

132
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38.920
Rocky Balboa doesn't work with Apollo Creed.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40.040
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42.520
Of course he works with him, in Rocky III.

135
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49.280
Very good point. Call her, ask her.

136
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52.440
She doesn't have a phone. So we're going to her.

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56.280
Wow.

138
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58.760
You're very good.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00.760
You're a real brainiac…

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03.680
behind that cloth.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07.080
Which is just a little piece of cloth, in the end.

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08.400
That's it, you know?

143
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11.400
I have to stop in the 'hood a few minutes. I've got something to deal with.

144
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13.960
What? No way. Come on. We don't have time.

145
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15.880
What do you mean? I'm the prez.

146
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17.400
I can do whatever I want. Relax.

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29.360
Mr. President, are you gonna change your outfit?

148
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31.960
Are you going to wear a tie?  Please, sorry.

149
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33.840
How are you, sister? Alhamdulillah.

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35.920
Excuse me. Let her speak, let her speak.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37.640
It's protocol, Mr. President. No biggie.

152
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39.440
Ma'am, ma'am. I don't mind, let her.

153
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41.360
Excuse me, I have to talk to Stéphane.

154
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43.560
Salaam alaikum, sister. Salaam, it was me.

155
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45.720
No, that's blasphemous. Don't talk to me. Fuck you.

156
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47.840
Take me back in your team. I swear, I've changed.

157
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49.760
Listen to me, I'm not the same man.

158
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53.240
I went back to my ancestral land in the West Indies and I worked on myself.

159
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55.400
Man, the elections were 15 days ago. Who cares?

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58.120
People can change that quickly. I mean, it's just like speedreading.

161
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00.560
I have changed. You know what my people say?

162
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03.400
[speaking gibberish with West Indies accent]

163
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08.760
Do you know what that means?

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11.720
It means that we are two different rivers, with different paths,

165
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13.480
but landing both in the same sea.

166
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15.520
Together, moving in the same direction.

167
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18.000
Both of us. Come on, buddy. Don't do that. They're filming.

168
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19.800
No, we're not in the same direction. Stop.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22.120
You need me and I need you. Please. I don't need you.

170
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23.760
I'm doing all right. Huh?

171
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25.960
Get him out of here, please. Please, I'll do anything.

172
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27.840
Come on. You can't do this to me!

173
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30.560
Wait, this isn't an Islamophobic act, people.

174
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34.040
He's West Indian. I know him well.  I'm mixed race, you filthy racist!

175
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35.480
That was very West Indiesophobic.

176
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37.760
Let me go, I said! Sir, please. Stop. Leave.

177
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38.720
Let go of me now!

178
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41.880
Stay calm. Sir, stay calm. Leave.

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43.120
Sir! Sir!

180
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46.720
Okay, okay, come on. Enough. I can't breathe. Let go. Let me breathe.

181
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51.240
This here is a nice globe.

182
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54.840
Look at that roundness, that volume, that growth.

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57.360
I'll be damned. Excuse me for a second.

184
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03.920
You all right?

185
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08.800
Can you leave us, man?

186
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11.440
Okay.

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15.520
A bit further, perhaps, Mo?

188
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19.080
The perimeter is secure.

189
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20.240
You don't have an earpiece.

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21.840
What are you doing? So what?

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23.160
I'm just practicing.

192
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28.240
Are you coming to the inauguration?

193
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30.400
I'm telling you again, no.

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32.600
Look, if it's about Lamine, it's all good.

195
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35.760
I managed to get him a job in the Élysée kitchen for the community service hours.

196
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37.480
I've got him hooked up. Good for you.

197
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39.800
But that's not for me, all right?

198
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41.520
I liked my life from before.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44.120
It was serene. And now, it's gonna be a mess.

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47.640
Nothing is gonna change. It'll be just like before. Relaxing.

201
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48.920
For real.  Step back.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51.160
I'm sorry, you're not allowed to remain in this area.

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54.800
Well, not quite relaxing, but at least we'll be together.

204
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56.840
We couldn't start a family.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59.440
And I miss you, you know?

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01.160
Marion, I miss you.

207
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02.880
You have to come to the inauguration.

208
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05.040
We don't know how long we'll be able to still see him.

209
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10.560
Haven't you heard? I mean, we don't know how long we can protect him from the…

210
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15.040
Hey!

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17.840
He's stretching the truth a bit,

212
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20.400
but we did get a package with a bullet hidden inside a banana.

213
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22.040
That's just what people do.

214
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23.680
That's just how it is.  Listen.

215
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25.720
You're the president. That's what you wanted to be.

216
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27.640
I've never wanted to be first lady, okay?

217
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30.440
I've never wanted to be first lady, so good luck.

218
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32.400
Wait.  Come on. Know what?

219
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34.960
Let's give them a show. Come on, get out, get out, get out.

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36.640
Go on, Stéphane. Please.

221
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45.920
FOR OUR FUTURE FOR THE PLANET

222
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53.480
The enemy is in the house.

223
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55.280
Oh, no. Come on.

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58.320
Get out of here. You're not welcome. Oh, oh, JeanCarole!

225
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01.320
There are no enemies here. Only adversaries.

226
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02.720
Hello, Stéphane.

227
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06.280
Does someone have an E? No? Are you sure you don't?

228
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10.320
We're recycling the presidential election posters for the legislative elections.

229
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13.960
But to tell you the truth, we're struggling with the V, G, and As.

230
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15.520
Oh well, that's how it is.

231
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19.320
Speaking of legislative elections, do you want to go together?

232
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21.440
I'll make you prime minister. Prime?

233
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24.160
Prime ministress. Not minister?

234
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27.400
Prime minister. I got it right the first time.

235
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29.000
Well, that's hardly a valid excuse.

236
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32.160
Well, the point is, it's either that or the far right.

237
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34.160
I'm not saying no to the prime minister position,

238
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35.120
but I have conditions.

239
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37.080
It means that we phase out nuclear power.

240
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39.000
We reduce flights by 50%.

241
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41.480
We require a special authorization to have a third child

242
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42.880
because what do people do?

243
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44.920
They have one child, then two, then three children…

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47.200
I completely agree with you. …which means…

245
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50.000
All I want to implement is my "Eat well, for free" law.

246
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52.160
Yeah. I want to pay teachers in the 'hood more,

247
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54.120
and spread positive vibes with some social stuff.

248
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55.360
Great idea. Yeah.

249
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58.680
That's it. Beyond that, do what you want. Will you be at the inauguration tomorrow?

250
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00.440
No, I can't tomorrow. Can you move it?

251
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03.000
No, I can't.

252
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06.440
Oh well, I'll come tomorrow then. Corinne, my girl!

253
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10.440
Hey, "my girl"? There's no more "my girl," "my chick."

254
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11.600
You hear me?

255
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13.160
You don't own me, Stéphane.

256
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14.360
Okay.  Yeah.

257
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16.920
It was just an expression. Yeah, but it's a shitty expression.

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18.960
Okay. Okay.  You gotta stop.

259
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21.120
Actually, if you really want, you could say "my dick."

260
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26.320
Did you, uh, do the surgery on your lower body?

261
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28.680
No, you can say "my dick" to talk about your dick.

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30.000
Oh!

263
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32.040
You scared me. You got scared? Why?

264
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33.880
What are you afraid of? What's wrong with you?

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35.960
Do you have a problem with people changing their sex?

266
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39.560
No. Tell the truth.

267
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44.280
So this is the big day for President Blé,

268
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47.160
this local youth worker who comes from a diverse background.

269
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48.480
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION

270
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50.320
He was unknown to the public three months ago,

271
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52.640
and now has defied all expectations.

272
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56.400
It is today that he will take over as the 26th president

273
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57.960
of the Republic of France.

274
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00.760
Numerous obstacles stand before him.

275
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01.960
What's his agenda?

276
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05.360
Will he succeed in implementing his "Eat well, for free" measure?

277
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07.760
Will he win the next legislative elections,

278
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10.000
when he doesn't even have a political party?

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13.440
And most importantly, will he succeed in staying alive?

280
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18.160
Why are you running next to the car?

281
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21.040
Huh? Why are you running next to the car?

282
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23.040
Dude, are you crazy? I'm doing my job.

283
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25.160
Don't forget, there's a terrorist threat on your head.

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27.400
Pretty good job. Now they know which car I'm in.

285
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28.320
Huh?

286
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34.560
♪ God blessblessblessbless ♪

287
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40.320
Damn it, he's got a point.

288
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53.520
Over here, please.  Please, Mr. President.

289
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07.520
Over here!  To the right!

290
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08.440
Look up.

291
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10.600
Mr. President!

292
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14.480
Welcome, Mr. President.

293
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21.360
Okay, so your fiveyear term, you're gonna rock it streetstyle.

294
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26.280
I mean, I just want to be myself. I'm from the 'hood. Everything's cool.

295
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28.280
Gotcha. Right on, fam. Right on.

296
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30.320
Sir, over here, please, Mr. President.

297
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31.840
You're from the 'hood.

298
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34.560
Over here! Look at us over here!

299
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36.480
Can we please go inside now? Yeah.

300
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40.080
I hate to break it to you, but being inside won't make it safer.

301
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42.360
Smile, big guy. Come on. Smile.

302
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43.960
Mr. President!

303
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44.880
Just relax.

304
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47.000
I'm trying to relax. No, don't worry.

305
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49.200
There, a little bit.

306
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50.320
Over there.

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53.160
Right? We're good.

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54.960
Over here.  Yeah, let's go.

309
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58.520
Ah!

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00.720
JeanPierre. Hello.

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02.440
He's a legend here.

312
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03.600
Yes.

313
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05.720
That's awesome. So happy. Where are you from?

314
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08.560
Mali, Senegal, Gabon?

315
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13.200
I'm from Chambéry, Mr. President.

316
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18.320
There.

317
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19.760
So…

318
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23.080
JeanPierre introduced me to "Premier Gaou" from Magic System.

319
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25.680
He's a great guy. This way, I'll give you the tour.

320
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29.000
Yes, Michel, and while the two men are meeting in private

321
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31.960
about the fate of our country, let us show you again this footage,

322
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34.680
these historical images shot 15 minutes ago

323
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37.480
of a future Black president going into the Élysée,

324
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39.760
the future president whose clothing style…

325
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42.920
I wanted to watch.

326
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47.000
Hello.

327
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51.520
Getting braids too? Oh no, I'm not…

328
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53.400
Oh no, not you. Get out of here.

329
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56.400
Please, wait. Give me a minute, please!  No. I already know what you want.

330
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58.200
You want to take me to the inauguration

331
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00.360
to make Stéphane happy and rejoin his team.

332
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02.800
Yeah, that's exactly it. Wow. You're so smart, aren't you?

333
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04.920
Amazing. You're the one who's smart. A genius, really.

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06.920
The Uber's waiting up front, we should get going.

335
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08.880
No, seriously. You won't have time to…

336
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10.520
Hey, put me out of your mind.

337
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12.640
The Élysée isn't my place. Stop forcing it, damn it.

338
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13.600
Wow.

339
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16.720
That is an incredibly cowardly answer.

340
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19.240
Excuse me? It's so cowardly, what you just said.

341
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20.760
Think so? Hell, yeah.

342
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23.120
Sorry, but your man, he's at the Élysée right now,

343
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26.520
and he's putting himself on the line to accomplish something truly unique.

344
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30.520
Okay? He's standing up for his values. He's doing something significant.

345
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32.840
Mm. Do you realize where you guys come from?

346
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34.360
You come from here, you know?

347
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36.920
In the middle flows a river of shit here.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40.080
It's like a huge sewer. There's shit, there are rats.

349
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41.720
Deformed children. All right.

350
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43.760
There are ailments here… Okay, all right!

351
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46.680
…that do not exist in the capital. We got it. Enough. We got it. Okay?

352
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48.320
You come from the very bottom,

353
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51.240
and you have the opportunity to change things up there.

354
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53.800
Goddamn, it's the Élysée! I mean, whoa! Okay.

355
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55.800
Okay. Would you listen to me? Come on.

356
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58.560
I swear, over there, your man is changing things.

357
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01.800
And you? Nothing. You're putting braids on random people.

358
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05.720
Come on, it'll never suit her. Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.

359
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10.960
Braids on her? Are you serious?

360
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16.200
You have the opportunity to become the first Black first lady at the Élysée.

361
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18.840
Not to be a cleaning lady. That's big.

362
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24.800
Think about it.

363
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36.160
View of the gardens, oriented south, so

364
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop! Don't! Come on.

365
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40.800
What's the matter?

366
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45.240
You receive parcel bombs, right? Death threats from everywhere.

367
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48.840
You see a glass of water and you drink it, all relaxed, just like that.

368
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50.600
What if it was poisoned, hmm?

369
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52.480
I didn't drink it all.

370
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57.880
I mean, I drank it all, but I discreetly spat it out, so I'm good.

371
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00.280
Oh, that's impressive. A little bit like this.

372
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06.760
Yes, I got it. You spat it out. That's nice. Well done. Awesome symbol.

373
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10.200
Well done. I mean it. First day at the Élysée, and you spit.

374
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12.920
You spit on France. "Marianne, fuck you."

375
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16.000
No. Actually, I was pretending to drink.

376
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18.240
And so I pretended to spit.

377
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19.840
It's an old tai chi technique.

378
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23.040
The glass is empty.

379
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25.040
Hmm?

380
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30.960
Do you have something to write the codes?

381
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32.200
The codes?

382
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36.320
You got it?

383
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37.680
Dough.

384
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38.720
Underscore.

385
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41.200
Ninefour.

386
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42.920
Hoodsevenseven.

387
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46.880
Those are the nuclear codes?

388
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50.120
It's the WiFi password.

389
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51.280
Nuclear codes?

390
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52.600
Yeah.

391
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54.480
Nuclear codes don't exist. Yeah, I knew that.

392
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56.640
It's just a myth, you know? I know. Totally a myth.

393
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57.680
Anyhow…

394
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00.920
…you want some? No, thanks.

395
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04.040
Hold on, hold on, don't tell me it's drugs.

396
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07.120
Is it CBD?

397
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09.240
Mm…

398
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11.480
I don't see the point of CBD.

399
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12.800
Well, it's so as to not be high.

400
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15.920
Exactly. I don't see the point.

401
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18.640
Oh, that joint's pretty strong.

402
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20.680
Anyway, I think we've gone over everything.

403
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21.720
Mm…

404
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24.640
Good luck to you. I gotta go.

405
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27.200
Hold on, hold on. You can't just up and leave like that.

406
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29.000
Do you have any advice to share with me?

407
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31.720
Advice? Yes.

408
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34.720
What kind of advice can I give you?

409
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36.280
Hmm?

410
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39.240
Oh, yes. How could I forget?

411
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41.240
There's one very important thing. Mm?

412
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43.360
It's really something you gotta be careful about.

413
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44.680
Yeah, I know.

414
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47.480
It's about terrorism, the Arabs, all that.

415
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51.360
No, no, no, no. The food. The food. We eat nonstop here.

416
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53.360
And a fat president is unacceptable, right?

417
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54.320
Look at me.

418
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59.160
Uh, no, it's just my shirt. It's Look. It's

419
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01.040
Ah. Otherwise, see? You can go for it.

420
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03.000
Yeah. I must say, right here, it's absolutely

421
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05.400
It's solid. Go ahead. Come on, give it your best shot.

422
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06.920
Bam, why not? Give me a good punch.

423
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09.200
Mr. President, I'm not gonna hit you.

424
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12.440
Hit me. Go for it. What's wrong with you? Don't you have any fucking balls or what?

425
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14.040
Come on, damn it!

426
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18.560
Mr. President?

427
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21.080
Mr. President, are you okay?

428
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25.480
Are you sure you're okay?

429
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27.440
Yeah, I'm fine.

430
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29.480
So…

431
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32.560
salads, salads, salads.

432
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35.640
You all right? I'm fine, I'm fine.

433
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38.160
You're gonna change clothes, right?

434
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40.960
You're not going to the inauguration dressed like that?

435
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43.520
No, it's all good. I brought something, actually.

436
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46.280
It's gonna be dope. No worries.  All right. Great.

437
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54.440
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the republic.

438
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56.560
Ah, that's it. There he is.

439
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58.840
He looks awesome.  That's my son. My son.

440
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00.280
My son.

441
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18.320
ÉLYSÉE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

442
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30.120
Hello, everybody.

443
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33.880
I'm giving it to you straight. I won't be rambling on, all that.

444
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36.680
I'm gonna cut to the chase and be real with you, all right?

445
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39.680
A lot is riding on my shoulders, from the cities, to the countryside,

446
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42.400
the suburbs, even our French colonies around the globe.

447
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44.680
I'll try to disappoint as few people as possible.

448
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46.560
And I know what the media is saying. I hear it.

449
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48.600
"Stéphane Blé has no political agenda."

450
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50.400
Sure, they're not completely wrong.

451
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52.880
Hmm? Come on, man.  But I do have an agenda.

452
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54.920
I want all French people to wake up every morning

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57.280
knowing that France has got their backs, and they do now.

454
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00.120
I want equality, justice, and good health for everyone.

455
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02.240
That's my agenda. I want everyone to be good.

456
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04.720
In fact, my mission is to improve people's lives.

457
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06.600
It's to make France mleh.

458
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08.120
What? What does that mean?

459
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09.320
What the heck is that?

460
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11.800
What did he say? "Malé"?

461
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13.080
Is it French? "Blue"?

462
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14.760
Did he say, "France blé"?

463
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17.880
No, no, not France blé, France mleh.

464
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21.160
It's It's Arabic. "Mleh" means good, fresh, cool.

465
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23.560
There, that's what I plan to do during my fiveyear term.

466
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25.760
In order to do this, I'm gonna need everyone.

467
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29.320
And I need a prime minister that will be exceptional in her function.

468
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31.160
She's present with us.

469
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32.480
Corinne Douanier.

470
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47.040
Make some noise, make some noise, make some noise for Corinne Douanier!

471
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49.080
Well, that was embarrassing.

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53.840
All right, great. Bad timing. I guess this isn't the mood.

473
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55.480
Uh, all right, let's get started then.

474
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56.920

Congratulations. Thank you. Thanks.

490
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12.680
Sure. I'm not sure yet, but we'll see…

491
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28.600
Thanks so much.

492
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34.480
Okay. I, uh, I agree to come live at the Élysée.

493
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37.080
But I'm warning you, I will not be your trophy wife.

494
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38.120
Definitely not.

495
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41.520
I want Black people's lives to change. If they don't, there's no point, Stéphane.

496
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43.600
One hundred. I want to work on real issues,

497
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46.960
deal with real problems, like colonial reparations, no less.

498
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48.520
Couldn't agree more. Okay.

499
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50.480
We can talk about it tonight in bed, if you want.

500
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53.840
No, no. What bed? Forget it. I want my own bed.

501
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56.200
I don't think that's possible. It's not that huge here.

502
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58.400
Yes, it is. There are 10,000 square feet here.

503
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00.680
We'll find solutions. There's a lot of wasted space.

504
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03.280
Yeah. Keila's calling me. Hello, Keila?

505
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06.120
Yes, girl, I'm at the Élysée. I won't lie!

506
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09.600
Have you heard about consent?

507
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12.080
You were the one who told me you wouldn't say no

508
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13.600
to the prime minister position.

509
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15.440
Yeah, but not saying no isn't saying yes.

510
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18.160
But I'm saying yes.

511
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21.680
But on one condition. You preside, but I govern.

512
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24.160
And I want a social, ecological, feminist France.

513
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25.800
A France that's mleh.

514
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27.560
Yeah.

515
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29.120
All right.

516
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31.400
Okay.

517
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34.600
But if you don't mind, I really have to go pee.

518
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35.560
I need to go bad.

519
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59.160
So, you dumbass, is Marianne still a dirty whore?

520
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05.080
That's just stress.

521
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40.600
Are you okay, Mr. President?

522
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44.320
Are you for real?

523
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48.520
I took him down like this, bam! I put him on the ground.

524
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50.480
Then I hit the motherfucker. I hit him hard.

525
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52.440
But that didn't stop me. I'm from the real 'hood.

526
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54.480
People don't know. You catch my drift? All right.

527
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56.960
What matters right now is that you're alive, all right?

528
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58.800
We shouldn't tell the press about the assault.

529
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01.040
Douanier's nomination was well received,

530
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03.520
so we're gaining points for the legislative elections.

531
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04.440
Let's stay positive.

532
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06.880
A president who knows how to deliver a punch, pretty awesome.

533
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09.520
No, it's not pretty awesome. This isn't the 'hood or whatever.

534
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11.400
We will not talk about the assault.

535
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13.600
You're absolutely right. I'm totally in agreement.

536
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15.280
Thanks. Let's stay positive.

537
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18.720
And I'm truly sorry. Yes, there was a little mishap on our end.

538
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20.800
But we're definitely going to get his accomplice.

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22.320
I don't understand. What accomplice?

540
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24.320
The terrorist couldn't have done it alone.

541
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27.320
There has to be someone inside the Élysée who helped him get in.

542
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29.040
Someone we saw, someone who's among us.

543
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30.800
I'm not accusing anyone, of course,

544
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33.000
but I'll make it my personal responsibility.

545
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35.160
Thank you, Alice. Okay, well…

546
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36.480
have a good night.

547
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38.600
Bye.  Okay, Stéphane.

548
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41.600
Good evening. You're safe now. At least, you should be.

549
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44.320
We'll work on the ministers' meeting tomorrow, all right?

550
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46.800
Get some rest, do something, keep yourself busy.

551
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48.080
See you. Hold on Okay.

552
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50.040
You guys are all leaving. Okay.

553
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51.520
And here I am, alone.

554
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53.400
Yes, Mr. President?

555
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56.720
Yeah, uh, do you serve anything simple to eat,

556
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59.640
like a gyro, a fat burger, or chicken nuggets?

557
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04.120
We have poached cockerel fillet with an oyster mushroom sauce.

558
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07.440
What kind of sauce? Oyster mushroom, Mr. President.

559
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11.520
Never mind. Have a good night.

560
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13.400
Have a good night, Mr. President.

561
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21.800
You got a minute?

562
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24.200
Where were you earlier? I almost got killed.

563
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26.720
There's been some minor issue.

564
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29.440
It was after your speech.

565
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31.680
I was looking for terrorists everywhere, you know?

566
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34.600
Keeping watch, 360 degrees.

567
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36.960
And I saw this weird guy, you know?

568
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40.240
He looked like a total Nazi, for real, with a big head.

569
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42.400
So what did I do? I stepped in.

570
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46.160
With a chokehold and an armlock, I neutralized him completely.

571
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48.600
I roughed him up a little. And he's there.

572
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53.960
Who is it?

573
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57.840
At first, I didn't know. He was talking strange.

574
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00.400
Then I looked it up on the Internet. It's Norwegian.

575
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01.920
Why does he speak Norwegian?

576
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05.120
Because he's the ambassador of Norway. Oh, fuck.

577
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11.560
You do this to me on my first day? That's some jail time, your bullshit.

578
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14.800
It's okay, we're gonna figure this out.

579
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19.040
