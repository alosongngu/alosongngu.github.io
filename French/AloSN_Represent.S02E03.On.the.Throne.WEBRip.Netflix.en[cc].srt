1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11.640
Mr. President.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16.800
It's the president. He's hot.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20.240
So?

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22.400
Nothing for now.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23.400
No news?

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25.840
Mmmm.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32.600
All right, so, uh, his condition is stable.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34.920
But I can't promise anything.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36.760
You should expect the worst. What?

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39.120
Is my husband going to be disabled?

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41.040
No, no, no. That's not possible.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44.440
He's not going to, okay? I've cleaned old white people's poop here.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46.600
I've cleaned their pee. Never again.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49.320
Can you see me taking care of a vegetable like this…

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52.720
No, no, no, no, no. I'd rather him be dead.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56.240
Well, in that case, that's good, because his life might be cut short.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01.520
Is it okay that I see him?

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03.920
Of course, Mr. President.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32.800
Dad.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35.080
It's Stéphane, your son.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41.120
I know we don't know each other well…

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45.560
but I was really hoping we could make up for lost time, Dad.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49.600
Sensation.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52.280
What?

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55.360
Dad, what? What's happening? Are you feeling your hand, your legs?

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56.640
Pleasure.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01.520
It makes me pleased to know that you're still alive, Dad.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02.600
Anus.

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09.840
Anus.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11.640
Did he speak?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14.960
Uh, yeah, I think his subconscious mind is speaking.

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18.600
REPRESENT

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29.360
Yesterday, Claude Blé, the president's father,

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31.560
was the victim of a horrifying attack.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34.040
He's currently in a deep coma.

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36.760
How is the president? He's deeply affected, obviously,

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38.000
but he's safe right now,

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41.160
and intends to run his campaign for the legislative elections.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44.120
The Élysée would also like to thank and acknowledge

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45.920
the efficiency of the police,

41
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48.080
who arrested the alleged offender.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51.840
He's being held in the antiterrorist unit as we speak.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55.040
What about the Queen of Norway's visit? Is it cancelled?

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57.400
No, it's not. Uh, in spite of the events,

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00.640
the president will still meet with Queen Anne of Norway.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04.520
Per Mrs. Douanier's wishes, he'll be inflexible on ecology,

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07.680
whale hunting, and oil exploitation in the North Sea.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10.160
Any other questions?

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14.880
Besides "Why wear a hijab

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17.160
while Iranian women fight for their right to take it off?"

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19.880
Yeah. That's what I thought.

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21.440
Thanks.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25.560
Mr. President, I just wanted to say,

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27.800
I know I wasn't on my game in regard to what took place,

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30.560
but I can assure you that you are now completely safe at the Élysée.

56
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33.040
Sorry, excuse me? I just wanted to discuss with you…

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34.680
What? But it's about time, isn't it?

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37.080
After two assassination attempts. Thanks for the favor.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38.440
Okay Honestly, thanks a lot.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40.160
Yeah, all right Can we say "thanks"?

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42.960
Thanks, you're welcome. But security isn't an exact science.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44.520
It should be. I just wanted to say,

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46.360
don't go meet the suspect.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49.160
We know it's him who helped the other terrorist, and you're safe now.

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51.400
Mo agrees with me. I want to know what's on his mind.

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52.920
Come on. It's Can I talk with him?

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54.600
No, it's a bad idea. Why do you want to?

68
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57.560
We perfectly know what's in his mind. He's a disgusting white fascist…

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59.320
Well, no. …who eats sauerkraut.

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01.440
Mr. President, it's not what you think. Let's go.

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04.000
No. Yes, okay, let's go. As you wish.

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05.360
Anyway, you decide.

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13.080
Filthy Negro.

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17.880
Huh?

75
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20.880
Did I just hear an accent? Jesus Christ!

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27.080
It's him?

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29.560
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I warned you. Yes, it's me.

78
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31.240
And I have no regrets.

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34.280
I'd do it again, if I could. If given the chance, I wouldn't hesitate.

80
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39.600
My brother, wait, what's your problem? I don't understand.

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43.720
Who's your brother, you baboon? Huh? You're not my president.

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46.880
People like you want to steal all the baguettes from the French.

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48.760
And you take advantage of state benefits.

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50.240
Wait, I… Ahem.

85
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53.040
People like him are people like you. What do you mean?

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54.280
You, hijab girl.

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57.200
Don't you have a sheep to butcher in your bathtub?

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00.440
Do you find that funny? Not at all.

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02.440
No, I'm not laughing, but it was kind of funny.

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03.720
Shut your mouth, you Turk.

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05.680
Think I'm a Turk, man?

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06.840
Come on, I'll show you… No.

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08.560
Me, Turkish? Bitch. What the fuck? Stop.

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10.720
I've got Black features. My father is Black, all right?

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13.600
Calm down. Chill now, William. Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15.320
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18.480
My brother, I don't…

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20.800
I don't know what's going on.

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23.520
Maybe you just got your citizenship, so you're feeling emotional,

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24.880
but you're losing it, my friend.

101
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27.560
I'm on your side, man. You're someone's pawn.

102
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30.240
Really? On my side? On my side to give me what?

103
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33.400
What are you going to do for me that French people haven't already done for me?

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36.240
I'm a French citizen. From Chambéry.

105
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40.360
What we want right now is to send you back to your jungle of monkeys.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42.000
There.

107
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45.480
We want a real president. A French president of France.

108
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52.440
What did he say?  I spoke Creole.

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55.720
Yeah, right. Sometimes you add some R's and sometimes you remove them, hmm?

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59.040
I mean, he thinks he's more Creole than red beans and rice.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01.120
He might as well learn the language.

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06.040
While some mandates start with a state of grace,

113
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08.760
that of President Blé is already a fiasco.

114
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11.160
Following the assassination attempt on his father,

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13.840
Stéphane Blé will attempt to regain his composure

116
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16.760
by hosting the Queen of Norway with grandeur and formality.

117
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19.640
However, this visit has already sparked controversy,

118
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22.680
with critics expressing their concerns about excessive spending

119
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25.520
during a time of economic hardship for the French people.

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27.560
As the legislative elections approach,

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30.360
President Blé appears to be in a precarious situation,

122
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32.520
confined within the walls of the Élysée.

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33.840
Cognard for president!

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36.640
Cognard for president! Thank you. Thank you.

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40.200
First and foremost, I would like to wish a speedy recovery

126
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41.440
to Mr. Claude Blé.

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43.560
He's faking it!

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45.720
No, it's all good. It's all good.

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47.760
We know that he's from the Ivory Coast.

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49.600
So he'll get free treatment.

131
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51.960
Thanks a lot, France.

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56.320
I am here with you today because we have had enough.

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57.240
Exactly.

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59.080
Hey, Blé!

135
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00.640
We're fucking starving, Blé!

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02.920
WE BEHEADED LOUIS XVI WE CAN DO IT AGAIN

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05.920
His "living together" ideals and his "France mleh,"

138
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07.640
that's just hot air.

139
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08.600
It's a scam!

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11.280
He's playing with us while stuffing our money in his pockets.

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12.720
That's right!

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15.560
We don't have a president anymore, but an African king.

143
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20.760
Legislative elections are a long way off. We want power, and we want it now.

144
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21.760
Yeah!

145
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23.320
GET OUT, BLÉ

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25.640
Blé, resign now! Blé, resign now!

147
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27.080
Blé, resign now!

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28.520
Am I interrupting?

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30.880
No, no, come in.

150
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32.200
Blé, resign now!

151
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33.760
You're not our president!

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36.280
Are you okay?

153
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39.440
Soso. Everyone hates me.

154
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42.600
Unless there's a miracle, I'm gonna get crushed at the legislative elections.

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44.120
No, it's…

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47.800
I was supposed to go to Guadeloupe for the béké tax, but…

157
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49.640
I think I'll stay.

158
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52.040
No, actually, you should go to Guadeloupe. It's important.

159
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53.560
Are you sure? Be careful over there.

160
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54.920
People are really angry. Yeah.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56.840
Really. Ask your guy to come with you.

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58.120
Aimé? Yeah.

163
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00.360
I'm not sure if that's necessary.

164
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02.600
Yeah, it's important. But he can't leave you alone.

165
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05.280
I'll make sure to ask Mo to keep me in the loop.

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06.200
Okay.

167
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14.720
Not everyone hates you, Stéphane.

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17.320
I don't hate you.

169
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38.120
Hey, what are you doing?

170
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39.400
May I kiss you?

171
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40.360
Of course not.

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41.320
I respect that.

173
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43.680
I should hope that you respect that, Stéphane.

174
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46.160
What if I insist a bit? It's called marital rape.

175
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48.560
Even if you're my wife? Especially because I'm your wife.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51.240
That's the concept. Hence, marital. Hmm. Mmhmm.

177
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52.920
We're not like that.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55.880
No, not like that at all. It's haram, yeah.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57.080
Worse.

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58.400
Heard of hell? Mm.

181
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00.680
Touch me again and I send you there on a bobsled, okay?

182
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02.280
Alhamdullilah. Loud and clear. Got it?

183
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04.560
All right. We'll be in touch. Let's keep in touch.

184
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06.400
See you later, baby.

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07.800
What did you say?

186
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12.680
Let's see each other after the béké thing. The béké tax, béké family…

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14.120
Uhhuh.

188
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26.960
Don't let the demonstrations get to you.

189
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29.080
First of all, there are only men, and on top of it,

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30.760
it's obviously led by the far right.

191
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33.480
What do you think? I deal with that every day at Matignon.

192
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36.120
"Lesbian," "feminazi," "tree hugger," so…

193
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39.680
Why bother, you know? I can't help but bother, honestly.

194
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43.280
Every night, I hear, "Blé, you're a dead man!"

195
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45.040
"Blé, your mother drinks Sprite!"

196
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48.160
Guess what I else heard? "Blé, your mom's in a boubou thong."

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50.720
I googled it. They don't even exist. Boubou thong.

198
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52.080
Come on, forget about it.

199
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54.560
It's the old confusion between tradition and eroticism.

200
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55.680
It's exhausting.

201
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57.240
Okay, so…

202
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00.920
I know why you're inviting the Queen of Norway.

203
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03.360
Hold on, let me explain.

204
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05.000
Come on, Corinne It's a symbol.

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08.840
And it's powerful, like those from the bottom facing those from the top.

206
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11.600
A multicultural nation like France facing the old Europe.

207
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12.720
It's so powerful.

208
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14.520
Yeah, that's exactly it.

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15.920
That's exactly it.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17.880
Wow!

211
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20.080
But I'll give you my notes on the fishing quotas,

212
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23.400
the slaughter of the whales, offshore gas, fossil fuel.

213
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26.160
Yeah, I'd love to, I'd love to. Not "I'd love to." You have to work.

214
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28.360
Stéphane, it's super important. Mmhmm.

215
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31.040
If you make the Queen of Norway give in, your mandate is assured.

216
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32.880
You'll be the king of the world. Mmhmm.

217
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36.120
However, if you mess it up…

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39.160
you'll disappoint millions of us.

219
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41.840
And you'll end up in the trash cans of history.

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43.560
Blue trash can or black trash can?

221
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49.840
No. I never joke about recycling.

222
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50.760
Me either.

223
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53.000
A piece of paper in the sewers, know where it ends up?

224
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54.320
The sewers?

225
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55.800
On a turtle's head, fool.

226
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59.000
Don't make any concessions with the queen.

227
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03.240
PRESIDENT BLÉ WELCOMES QUEEN OF NORWAY

228
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05.480
You have to sell some fighter jets, or we're screwed.

229
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08.760
Uh, I'm not sure Corinne will agree to that.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10.800
Corinne doesn't decide. Neither do you, okay?

231
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13.640
Right now, the Norwegians have us by the balls.

232
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15.200
They decide.

233
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20.000
Do you know why this whole ambassador story hasn't been leaked yet?

234
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22.880
They want to use it for leverage. To better negotiate.

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24.840
We can't do anything.

236
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27.400
If that gets out, you and Mo are out.

237
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29.120
Like far out. You too?

238
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31.520
Not at all. You have to be a good negotiator with the queen.

239
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33.040
How good are you? Me?

240
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35.400
So, one time, I went to the market in Marrakesh

241
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37.720
Yeah, all right, you suck. We gotta find something else.

242
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40.680
She's old, you're young.

243
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43.520
You don't have, uh, a goodlooking face.

244
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46.320
But in there, there must be something.

245
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47.720
What are you talking about?

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49.760
Come on, spit.

247
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53.160
Stop it.

248
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55.120
That's what she wants.

249
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56.840
You nuts? Cut it out. That's not my thing.

250
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00.200
Oh, it's not your thing? No, it's Mo's thing, but it's not for me.

251
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02.680
Of course, it's everyone's thing. That chick is pretty hot.

252
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04.880
Check her out. Are you saying it's your thing?

253
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05.800
Huh?

254
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08.320
No.

255
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09.680
No, but uh…

256
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11.480
she's not ugly.

257
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13.440
I could do it, I could do it. Stop.

258
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14.640
I won't do that.

259
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16.920
All right, then we have to find something else.

260
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20.560
You should look pitiful.

261
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23.880
Do your typical dumb African look.

262
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25.160
A classic.

263
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27.120
There, that one. It's great.

264
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28.560
What? I did nothing. You did.

265
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30.920
You had your eyes like this, looking completely lost.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33.720
Like an African guy saying, "Hey, what's happening right now?"

267
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36.320
It was great. What were you thinking about? Nothing?

268
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37.600
Well, then do that.

269
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39.000
Keep that.

270
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40.360
All right? Let's do that.

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42.640
In front of the queen, you go,

272
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45.120
"Oh, really? I ain't got no idea on the matter." Okay?

273
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46.840
The door!

274
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52.320
It's not in my job to do that. Guys, it's not my job…

275
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05.760
You okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

276
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07.120
Relax, relax.

277
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09.920
What did you put on? What's that?

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11.720
It's Norwegian, to win her favor.

279
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14.200
I've never seen a Norwegian rocking this awful thing, dude.

280
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16.520
Come on, it's their custom. Take it off, take it off.

281
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20.400
Her Majesty, the Queen Anne of Norway.

282
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22.680
Your Highness, this way!

283
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25.400
Please, Your Highness!  To the left!

284
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27.120
Your dress is beautiful.

285
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29.960
What made you want to come and visit him?

286
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31.520
Kiss her. Kiss her. Huh?

287
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32.960
Kiss her hand. Oh.

288
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36.720
Too noisy. Way too noisy.

289
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40.200
Welcome to France, Your Majesty.

290
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42.680
Thank you for your hospitality!

291
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46.560
Her Royal Highness thanks you for your hospitality.

292
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48.480
That's what I thought.

293
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49.600
All right.

294
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50.960
Welcome.

295
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52.440
Welcome.

296
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57.000
Bambambambam.

297
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58.920
Cut it out. Sorry.

298
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06.040
Let me introduce you to Djigui.

299
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08.600
Hello. He's one of the best entrepreneurs here.

300
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11.040
A remarkable success story of going from rags to riches.

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12.800
Nice to meet you. He's an event planner.

302
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14.520
Did you rent your tuxedo?

303
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17.280
I'd also like to introduce you to Lamine.

304
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20.640
I love him like a son. A very talented and good chef.

305
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26.440
He's been cooking for a year.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27.960
Good day.

307
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30.560
It's a pleasure. He's so cute.

308
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31.960
Hello.

309
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35.240
Stéphane isn't a good person. He's a loser.

310
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37.680
Shh! Uh, my friend, you don't need to translate that.

311
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38.960
It's all good, okay? Jeanette!

312
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41.320
This is my mother, Simone.

313
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43.560
Nice to meet you, Your Highness.

314
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45.560
My mother is religious, as you are.

315
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47.560
Do you go to church every Sunday like we do?

316
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49.840
To the temple. Her Royal Highness is a protestant.

317
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52.240
Protestants are often liars.  All right then.

318
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54.160
All right, let's cut to the chase.

319
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57.480
We're going to sit down for the rest of the protocol, please.

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01.200
Jeanette, why are you doing this? Well, simply because I don't like to lie.

321
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02.360
You're annoying.

322
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05.960
It's all good. Marion's arrived safely in Guadeloupe.

323
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08.600
Zero problem. She's at the Blue Parrot Hotel.

324
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10.280
Cool. Is that a nice hotel?

325
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13.440
Yeah, um, it's nice. Very nice.

326
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15.800
Very nice.

327
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18.720
"Near the most beautiful beaches of the island,

328
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20.800
the Blue Parrot Hotel is a lovers' paradise."

329
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22.200
"In the shade of the palm trees,

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25.200
you'll be able to fulfill your wildest fantasies."

331
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27.280
That's a nice description.

332
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29.520
Yeah.  I'm glad she's in a nice spot.

333
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31.800
Yeah, it's cool. Goes to show the gays have good taste.

334
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32.920
Keep me posted.

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34.680
Yeah, I'll keep you posted, brother.

336
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37.640
Oh fuck. Fuck.

337
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39.440
I have a question. Huh?

338
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42.760
What's with that guy giving you the stink eye?

339
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44.640
Who's giving me the stink eye? Over there.

340
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45.640
Where? Where?

341
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47.960
Oh.

342
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49.960
Um, racism.

343
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53.600
There's a lot of racism in Norway. I mean, it's real.

344
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05.600
Good evening to all of you.

345
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08.720
Uh, in honor of the esteemed visit from the Queen of Norway,

346
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11.760
I have made the choice to introduce a traditional "ailing" dancer.

347
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13.240
"Halling. Halling."

348
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14.360
Right. Halling.

349
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16.280
No, it's not Arabic. It's Norwegian.

350
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18.200
Halling!  Yeah.

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20.120
It's not easy to say.

352
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21.720
Whoo!

353
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40.920
Whoa.

354
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44.200
He's really good with his leg.

355
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46.480
He's really flexible. Pretty good.

356
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04.960
Bravo.

357
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07.520
Fantastic.

358
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11.480
Bravo.  She congratulates you.

359
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13.400
Am I not treating you like a king or something?

360
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16.960
Right? This whole ambassador thing, can't we solve it together, or no?

361
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26.400
I would very much like to see you dance halling.

362
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30.560
The Queen would like to see you dance a halling.

363
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31.480
What?

364
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33.160
Halling.

365
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35.400
Right now.

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36.840
Halling.

367
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38.280
Go ahead.

368
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41.320
Uh, you want me to dance now?

369
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42.320
Mm.

370
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45.720
Hold on.

371
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51.680
What's up?

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53.520
She wants me to dance a halling now.

373
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54.840
Ah, fuck.

374
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58.720
Well, listen, uh, that's some weird old Norwegian chick's kink, you know?

375
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00.800
Yeah, but what do I do? Well, you do it. What else?

376
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02.400
No! Well, you're her bitch, man.

377
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06.440
So either you do what she tells you to do, or you end up in prison.

378
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08.720
So go halling. Go do it.

379
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11.800
Come on. Halling. Halling for the president.

380
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14.800
Halling! Halling! Halling!

381
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16.800
For Norway!

382
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19.880
You're the bitch of Norway. Come on. It was planned, y'all.

383
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21.680
It was planned all along.

384
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24.040
Of course it was planned.  Yeah, of course.

385
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25.200
Come on.

386
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26.240
Cool.

387
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37.240
Three, four.

388
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44.920
Superb.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49.000
Awesome. Honestly, he's pretty good.

390
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57.960
Wow.

391
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58.960
Loser.

392
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02.360
He can't even dance.

393
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04.440
The white man danced better than him.

394
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12.440
Bravo!

395
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13.880
Bravo!

396
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15.600
Wow, wow!

397
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27.320
The Queen congratulates you.

398
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28.560
So, are we even now?

399
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30.080
Is it cool? We even?

400
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33.800
Listen, little shit.

401
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35.520
Listen carefully, little shit.

402
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39.440
She really said "little shit" to me, or…  She did, yes.

403
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40.880
Don't give a fuck about halling.

404
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42.760
I don't give a fuck about halling.

405
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46.040
If I tell the press you beat up my ambassador…

406
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49.120
If we tell the media that you beat up my ambassador…

407
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51.360
…your buddy gets life in jail.

408
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53.120
…your bud gets life in prison.

409
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55.000
You'll be charged with aiding.

410
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57.200
You go down for aiding.

411
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59.560
So it is in your interest to be generous.

412
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02.160
So you'd better be very generous, biatch.

413
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05.440
"Biatch," did you come up with that, or was that her?

414
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07.320
I added that part. Oh.

415
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09.400
So what have you got for us?

416
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10.560
Well, I've…

417
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13.080
I've thought about it, and I'm thinking…

418
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15.920
Three Rafale jet fighters should be enough.

419
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17.080
And we call it even.

420
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19.320
Would three Rafale fighter jets be enough?

421
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20.560
Three Rafales? Yeah.

422
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23.360
Three Rafales?

423
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26.800
All right, five. But I won't offer any more than that.

424
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30.240
Five Rafales, game over. That's all. Deal. Case closed.

425
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31.960
Five is the best he can do.

426
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35.480
But he's a complete idiot.

427
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37.040
Mm.

428
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39.200
I thought we'd be negotiating…

429
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40.120
Five.

430
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44.280
…one or two North Sea fishing quotas.

431
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45.600
Are we in business?

432
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50.160
Ask him for a nuclear power plant.

433
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53.880
Your Majesty, he can't be that stupid.

434
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55.120
Just ask him.

435
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59.000
The five Rafale fighters aren't enough.

436
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00.680
We want a nuclear plant too.

437
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02.080
She's really good.

438
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03.680
She's quite the business whiz.

439
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06.520
But that's a no. I have to say no.

440
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08.240
No. I won't budge.

441
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10.320
And you can look at me with your beautiful blue eyes

442
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12.000
and your beautiful interpreter blue eyes,

443
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14.520
and your blond hair that's soft like silk, I won't budge.

444
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15.600
I just won't. Sorry.

445
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17.440
You can even tell her in her language.

446
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21.280
That means absolutely nothing.

447
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23.600
And it's racist.

448
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25.480
That's true.

449
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28.360
I apologize. It was stupid. Really sorry.

450
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29.280
Forgive me?

451
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32.200
All right. You rock.

452
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35.280
["Nubian Farlow" by Varnish La Piscine playing]

453
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57.280
Aren't you ashamed of yourself? What's going on?

454
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58.360
Why did you do that?

455
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00.960
Why did you sell Rafale fighters and nuclear plants to Norway?

456
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03.360
Uh, it's not all what you think. Let me explain.

457
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04.440
I thought we agreed.

458
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07.400
How could you betray me like this? How could you betray us all like this?

459
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08.400
Betray France?

460
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11.000
I was inflexible about the whales. Yeah, great.

461
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14.280
They won't be killed by harpoons, but exterminated by radioactive waste.

462
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16.680
Awesome. Believe me, I couldn't do anything.

463
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17.760
You could have chosen.

464
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20.040
You know that I support all your causes, everything.

465
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22.000
In fact, we're gonna do something for Tibet soon.

466
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23.040
I don't follow.

467
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24.760
Well, your hat and all that.

468
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27.040
Not at all, I just find it beautiful.

469
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29.040
Oh. And don't change the subject.

470
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32.680
Why did you sell Rafale fighters and nuclear plants to Norway?

471
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33.920
What did I tell you?

472
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39.240
It's top secret.

473
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44.200
So you're a liar on top of being a coward. You really are a man. You know what?

474
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46.280
"Your words are like a bizarre melody

475
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48.480
Deception dances upon your tongue

476
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50.160
A web of lies are spun

477
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52.160
These lights so dim won't light your path

478
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53.600
Leaving you in gloom

479
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55.120
No matter how you try

480
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58.120
They won't shine bright Like stars in the sky on a dark night

481
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00.200
For the one who comes one day A fleeting stay

482
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02.960
Like a whisper in the wind Slipping into the void"

483
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05.680
Here. What is that?

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08.160
What is it? Read it.

485
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11.800
What's this thing?

486
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13.040
I can't read it.

487
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14.120
It's smeared.

488
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15.080
Can you see?

489
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16.960
No, I can't read it.

490
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18.880
Oh, it's because ink without additives.

491
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21.200
On recycled paper, it smears.

492
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24.080
You have to use one or the other, but both together, it doesn't work.

493
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25.840
Anyway, it's my resignation. Hold on.

494
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27.360
Stop playing with me. No, I'm not.

495
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29.240
You know what? You used to be a good person.

496
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31.880
But now, you're a piece of shit. Politics turned you.

497
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34.880
And I won't become a piece of shit. So I'm leaving, goodbye, I quit.

498
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36.840
Long live the republic.

499
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41.000
Fuck, I'm sure she's radicalized.

500
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43.560
I'll put her on the terrorist watch list.

501
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46.200
We know white women like this.

502
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48.480
First they speak Arabic, then they bomb the Métro.

503
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59.280
With us tonight, Madam Prime Minister.

504
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00.840
Let's talk about your resignation.

505
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04.040
Why do you think French people don't trust politics anymore?

506
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06.360
Why are they angry? Because they've been betrayed.

507
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08.440
They've been lied to.

508
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11.680
As a matter of fact, President Blé got elected on a social platform,

509
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14.880
and as soon as he's in power, he sells weapons and nuclear plants.

510
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17.560
He shouldn't be surprised by the disavowal of the people.

511
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20.240
If he wants to behave like an asshole, that's his choice.

512
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22.960
But I won't follow his path. Neither will the French.

513
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40.440
I really don't want to go, to be completely honest.

514
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42.800
Do you think I want to go?

515
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45.080
Let me remind you we don't have a political party.

516
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46.680
He's got a structure, local supporters.

517
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48.480
With him, we have a chance to win.

518
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51.520
But without him, the far right will be in charge in a month.

519
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52.600
Guaranteed.

520
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55.600
With Cognard in Matignon, we'll deal with deportations.

521
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56.720
It'll be horrible.

522
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59.560
No more France Blé. It's France mleh.

523
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01.040
Yeah, well, whatever.

524
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03.360
Honestly, I don't want to do it. You do. You're staying.

525
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06.600
Come on, Stéphane, Stéphane. No, no. What the hell, man? Come on.

526
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09.080
Don't do this. Are you serious? It's over there.

527
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11.280
Over there. We're going over there.

528
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14.000
There. On the left, at number 46. Come on.

529
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18.040
Are you sure?  I'm positive.

530
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19.520
Think about it.

531
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21.800
Have you ever seen people get deported?

532
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25.080
Those poor ladies carrying all their bags and clattering pans,

533
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27.640
always politely saying, "Excuse me, please."

534
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28.680
Keep walking.

535
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30.800
"Please. I'm French like you. Let me stay in France."

536
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32.880
And the others answer, "No, you're not French."

537
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34.360
"Listen how you talk."

538
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36.360
Have you ever seen that? It's tragic.

539
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38.360
That makes me want to cry when the poor lady says,

540
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41.520
"Oh, I'm sorry, I have the papers." Go on. "No, you don't," they tell her.

541
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43.560
France, land of poets.

542
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46.600
Charles Baudelaire, Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset,

543
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48.480
and the list goes on and on.

544
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52.960
Being here today fills me with enormous pride and a profound sense of honor…

545
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56.440
to pay homage and inaugurate with you

546
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59.040
this new facility.

547
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04.800
The Francky Vincent Senior Center,

548
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07.840
after the man we already call the King of Souk.

549
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09.000
King of Zouk.

550
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11.840
Uh, King of Zouk, to be exact.

551
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14.560
The amazing singer of…

552
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16.800
"Alice, It Slips."

553
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18.960
"Alice, It Slips."

554
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27.960
Thanks a lot.

555
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32.440
Pardon me. Some drinks are available inside.

556
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33.520
A few refreshments.

557
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36.480
To what do we owe the honor of your visit, Mr. President?

558
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38.720
It's rare to see you in such a modest village.

559
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40.920
Actually, we'd like to offer you…

560
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44.240
prime minister.

561
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46.440
Are you having trouble with Mrs. Douanier?

562
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47.600
That's too bad.

563
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50.360
You seemed to get along so well.

564
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52.920
Ahem, well, we still get along really well,

565
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55.000
except that we're offering you Matignon.

566
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57.920
Let's do the legislative elections together

567
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00.040
and keep the far right from advancing.

568
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03.480
That's a plan that goes smoothly, and everyone's happy.

569
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05.520
What do you think, Jérôme?

570
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10.960
It's a huge responsibility. Mmhmm.

571
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14.240
But when the republic is at stake… Hmm.

572
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16.280
…one must make sacrifices.

573
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18.960
Wow. That's so well put. Amazing.

574
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20.600
And so true.

575
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24.480
I accept. But…

576
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26.840
I would prefer it if he asked me.

577
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31.760
I've just asked you for the both of us.

578
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33.040
No.  Considering…

579
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34.880
He'd like I heard.

580
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36.640
Okay, go ahead. Ask the question, then.

581
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42.880
Would you like to be my prime minister?

582
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45.640
I couldn't hear.

583
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48.400
Okay, would you like to be my prime minister?

584
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49.440
Now, I heard it, but…

585
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51.760
It was aggressive. Yes, and poorly articulated.

586
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54.640
Okay. Would you like to be my prime minister?

587
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57.440
I'd be delighted, Mr. President.

588
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00.440
But I'm warning you, don't mess with me on social matters.

589
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01.800
You can count on me.

590
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11.000
We did it.

591
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13.480
We're in power. Congratulations. Well done.

592
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17.040
"Well done." Are you stupid? No.

593
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20.040
I don't give a fuck about Matignon.

594
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22.920
Prime minister is an ejection seat.

595
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26.040
What I want, is the Élysée.

596
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29.320
So why did you accept?

597
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35.840
Because over there, in Matignon, I'll be able to take that moron down.

598
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37.760
That's right.

599
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40.720
I'll organize new elections. It'll be Cognard or me.

600
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42.880
It'll be me.

601
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45.080
Come on, you can't be suggesting a coup, right?

602
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50.280
You know, politics is like andouillette sausage.

603
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52.600
When they're well prepared, they always smell like shit.

604
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54.600
Do you have a problem with that?

605
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57.600
Hmm?

606
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01.080
No. Excellent.

607
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13.000
Stéphane, that's not possible. Andréï is the most despicable person.

608
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14.480
You can't do this.

609
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17.200
What do you prefer? The far right? Honestly, I don't know.

610
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19.120
Well, I know.

611
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21.560
Very well, I resign.

612
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23.160
You can't do that.

613
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26.360
Have you considered Iranian women whose brothers forbid them from going out?

614
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28.520
What's your point? Think hard. There is a point.

615
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29.960
We lost them.

616
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31.760
Who?

617
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34.040
Marion and Aimé.

618
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35.080
They were at the hotel,

619
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37.120
and then all of a sudden we completely lost contact

620
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38.600
and their phones aren't picking up.

621
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41.120
Maybe they don't have a signal.

622
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42.200
No, that's impossible.

623
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45.080
Aimé's phone is a secure line, so that means he always has signal.

624
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46.480
Unless there's a crisis.

625
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49.080
So that means they're Together?

626
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52.560
No. No, they're not together. It's impossible.

627
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53.880
I was gonna say "in danger," Mo.

628
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56.440
That's better. In danger.

629
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59.000
I mean And if I may, Mr. President,

630
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01.120
with everything that's happening in the West Indies,

631
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03.040
there's a lot of defiance toward the government.

632
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05.000
Yeah. My point is, we really must act fast.

633
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05.920
It's not safe.

634
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12.040
We gotta find her.
