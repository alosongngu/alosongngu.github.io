00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11.920
Tonight, join us live for the great debate between rounds.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14.600
The fate of France will be decided in a few days,

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17.320
and facetoface, the two campaign outsiders,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19.400
Stéphane Blé and Corinne Douanier,

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22.520
will debate and be judged by the French people.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24.600
Between the two, I'm not sure. They suck equally.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28.640
The great presidential debate is tonight, live at 8:00 p.m.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36.040
I checked the electors' list, and she didn't vote, Stéphane's wife.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37.920
Don't bother.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40.680
He's telling everybody she's been in Normandy since the IVF,

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42.840
but she never did the IVF.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47.160
A friend of mine at the clinic mentioned she was MIA.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48.760
That Lamine kid disappears,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50.120
then his wife disappears.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51.640
That seems like a lot.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56.160
It happens to coincide with a dealer kid winding up in a coma. Hmm?

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57.480
Yes.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59.640
It seems like a lot.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03.720
I don't think for a second that idiot will be the president.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07.880
We're live in 30 minutes!  Stéphane? It's your mom.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm here with Father Gontran, who came from Abidjan.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12.800
He'll bless you for the debate.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15.040
What are you doing? The debate starts in 30.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16.760
We need Stéphane on set now!

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18.640
Two minutes.  What's he doing?

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20.360
See you soon.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24.000
It hurts too much. Let's cancel. Huh? No, no. We're not gonna cancel.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25.240
So just breathe.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27.920
Just relax. I can't do it. It's too painful.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31.680
The stage fright is making my ball throb. Just breathe. Just breathe, Stéphane.

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34.800
Just breathe. Just breathe. Listen to me.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36.280
Let me tell you this now.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38.880
I'm not proud of this.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40.720
Look, I misled you, okay?

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42.360
I wasn't born in Sarcelles.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44.840
I'm from aa quiet little suburb in SeineetMarne.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46.120
My parents had money,

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48.920
and I got into politics, all because my father was in politics.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50.280
There's more.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52.440
I was never Aimé Césaire's greatgrandnephew.

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55.320
As for feeling Black, I never have. You for real?

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57.680
And I really hate going to Guadeloupe.

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00.360
When I was little, Malcolm X was not my hero.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03.280
No, it was Patrick Sébastien.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05.480
Well, not all his work. Uh, the candid cameras.

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08.040
Seriously, he did this one with Thierry Lhermitte.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09.640
I'm not sure if you know that one.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11.800
He invites him I really don't give a flying fuck.

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14.640
Right. Okay. Listen. Why would I tell you this?

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15.560
Because…

52
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18.880
you opened my eyes to the ghettos.

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20.160
Oh, fuck.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22.280
What you taught me is that,

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25.120
well, living in that area, it makes you strong.

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26.840
It's not a flaw.

57
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29.720
And you're not perfect, you know, Stéphane.

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32.440
Sorry to tell you, man. But you're honest.

59
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35.200
And for honesty,

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37.680
I only know one honest person really.

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40.520
It's Stéphane Blé, just so you know.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43.440
So now, this debate,

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46.280
you need to do it for the forgotten, for the oppressed people,

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48.880
for thethethe voiceless people, you understand?

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53.360
Are we doing this debate or what?

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57.800
Okay. We're going?

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59.120
Let's go. We're going?

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00.120
Okay. Okay!

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01.240
Ow! Careful! Right.

70
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03.640
You gotta change this diaper first, man. Huh?

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16.000
Could you enhance him a bit? Because it's very dark.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18.840
Can't you, uh, tone the color here? Just enhance.

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21.560
Well, just, can't you get get him to stand out?

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23.760
Hey, you know, the cosmetics they have aren't vegan.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25.840
We don't give a shit.

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27.560
Can't you add a little green?

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29.960
Doesn't green and brown make No, he'd just look gray.

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31.960
I am here for a battle.

79
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33.800
His skin tone needs to be enhanced.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35.280
I don't know how you do that.

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37.520
Because he's just He really needs to pop.

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40.160
We're live in two minutes.

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48.400
Oh, well, now. How are you? All right. All right, all right.

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51.080
Despite a bunch of trials on my ass.  You always manage.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53.800
Virginie, we need you on set. Yeah, all right.

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56.240
Éric, I have to go. Hey. Lay into those two, okay?

87
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58.720
Relax. I know my business.  I know.

88
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00.600
Listen, uh, this just occurred to me now.

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04.640
Uh, it seems a bit bizarre that Blé's wife just disappeared, doesn't it?

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06.240
Maybe you should grill him about that?

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09.640
No, I won't just invade his privacy. True. That's true. Uh, and his cousin?

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11.680
Did you know he's a drug dealer? What?

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13.080
I can never stop talking.

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16.000
No, I mean, his cousin, he runs a trap house. Yeah.

95
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18.840
Five years we've been trying to nab the guy. Désiré's his name.

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21.320
Yeah, he and Stéphane are thick as thieves.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23.040
Just imagine how they poison kids,

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24.960
with heroin, cocaine, the whole shebang.

99
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28.040
Anyway, I won't bore you. You know all this, right?

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30.000
You know your business.

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31.920
Take care, darling. Break a leg.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33.280
Okay. Later, Éric.

103
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42.520
What's going on? Oh, I really don't feel well right now.

104
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45.520
What's wrong? What do you mean? Drink this. Holy water.

105
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48.960
It's here straight from the little stream near my parish.

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51.680
That's a bad idea. This stuff here, you're gonna get worms.

107
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54.360
No way. Stop. Yes. No, he won't. Here, now. Drink.

108
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57.720
No! Whoa! No! Don't swallow.  Oh, my God! Gross.

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59.720
Now he's gon  We are live in one minute.

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03.560
Oh, okay. So who's the champ? You are, okay? So bring it home.

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06.600
Everything depends on this. We can do it. Give us a sign if you need us.

112
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08.800
Let's go, let's go. You'll be awesome.

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10.600
I believe in you. I believe in you!

114
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12.240
You got this.  Stéphane.

115
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17.160
I'm really pleased we're able to share this moment of democracy here.

116
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19.080
Me too. Thank you.

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22.320
We are live in 30 seconds.

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24.040
He's gonna take down that loser.

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27.360
What's that? Uh, uh, I'm sorry.

120
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31.600
Uh, excuse me?

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33.840
I suppose it's too late to do a toilet run, huh?

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35.800
Oh, you really mustn't. No, it's beginning.

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38.200
Too late. So sorry.  All right, let's go.

124
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41.640
We are live in five, four…

125
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44.680
Three, two, one.

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45.680
Cue credits.

127
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46.720
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48.520
THE DEBATE

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55.520
Good evening, everyone.

130
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57.960
Over 60 million citizens waited for this moment,

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59.960
and now, it's finally arrived.

132
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03.760
The debate between the two candidates in round two of the presidential election.

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06.720
Corinne Douanier and Stéphane Blé, both largely unknown.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09.000
Next Sunday, one of them will

135
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11.000
…become the 26th president Oh, dear God!

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13.520
…of the French Republic. Anything wrong, Mr. Blé?

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15.120
Nothing. No worries. Are you ready?

138
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16.920
We're real men. I'm not, uh… No crying.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19.560
Can we start the debate? Of course. Let's.

140
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22.680
Well, let's look at the intentions of the voters as the show begins.

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26.880
As you can see from the polls, France has not yet decided.

142
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30.520
To help you make up your mind, we're going to look at their profiles.

143
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33.720
Douanier, Blé, the match.  Oh, man.

144
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34.880
Let's begin. Whoo!

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38.480
PROFILES

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42.040
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.  It's pretty good, the schools.

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45.120
Hello!  Who is Corinne Douanier?

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46.840
Is this the old man from Sarcelles?

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49.400
We went to meet up with her in her headquarters

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51.200
and followed her throughout her day.

151
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54.000
But revegetation will happen in sync. Yeah, yeah.

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56.240
An activist at all times,

153
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59.680
Corinne Douanier holds degrees in economy and history.

154
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03.480
She is fluent in seven languages, including Afghan and Mandarin.

155
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05.240
And how's Terry? He's doing better.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07.200
That's great.  See you soon.

157
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08.480
Have a nice day.

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11.040
She became mayor of her village when she was 18.

159
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13.160
Oh, hello, Sandrina.  Hello, Corinne.

160
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16.320
Hey, you two, my VHS of Sacrifice of Tarkovsky?

161
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17.840
You borrowed it. Oh, I'm sorry.

162
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20.200
Well, I'm not a library. I'm mayor. Yes, I'll remember.

163
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21.600
All right. Have a nice day.

164
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24.920
The one who sings her praises is her loyal spokeswoman,

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27.440
Églantine Richet, who is deaf and mute.

166
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29.640
I first met Corinne…

167
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30.680
DOUANIER'S SPOKESWOMAN

168
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32.080
…just after my accident.

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38.240
And I was really moved by her desire to heal this ailing world

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40.720
in a very real way.

171
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44.160
And on three. One, two, three.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48.200
And whenever the candidate has some time to herself,

173
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50.200
Corinne prefers to dedicate it to others.

174
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52.800
She's clearly the reason I'm alive today.

175
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56.120
Around 15 years ago, after bocce ball, I just fainted.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59.360
I fell to the ground, and she… she just appeared.

177
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01.760
She knew what to do. CPR immediately.

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05.400
She brought me back to life. All that and with a broken arm.

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08.200
Come on! Go!  She was truly heroic that day.

180
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13.120
Hang on! Stay here! Stay here! That's it!

181
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15.040
No, it's true. We're under a lot of pressure.

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18.640
But that doesn't mean we don't relax a little bit every now and then, right?

183
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21.080
Even when we're… Shit.

184
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23.600
…saving lives. Let's go!

185
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26.560
Well known in the nonprofit world,

186
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28.200
Corinne defends a social model

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31.280
that's based primarily on the return to natural products,

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33.960
ecofeminism, and downsizing.

189
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37.760
One evening, we saw on TV what was happening in the Mediterranean

190
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38.720
with the migrants.

191
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41.240
Oh. I mean, the, uh, the refugees. The refugees.

192
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43.880
Sorry. Excuse me. We don't actually approve of that term. Sorry.

193
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46.560
And, well, in just three days, about… Where were we?

194
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49.920
The Mediterranean. You see? Right.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51.640
We're on an NGO ship to save lives.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56.920
In our village, we have the lowest CO2 emission rate in all of France.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58.920
And it's all thanks to her.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02.520
We need more to pitch in, and we can fix the climate overnight.

199
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04.680
It's simple and effective.

200
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05.960
PROFILES

201
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08.920
Hey. Hello, TV.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11.400
I didn't have time to throw anything on. I'm really sorry.

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12.880
But, I mean, why hide this body?

204
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15.400
Who is Stéphane Blé? I was a huge sports guy.

205
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16.960
To find out,

206
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19.600
we met with him at his apartment in Bobigny.

207
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21.960
I was in soccer, yeah.

208
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24.720
I was a champion, even. Champion of fair play.

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26.400
Nicest team in all of France.

210
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29.160
This is a portrait of my grandpa here. Film.

211
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32.680
He was an infantryman who took part in the World War II landings

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34.080
before he departed.

213
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36.040
He was thrown overboard.

214
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39.040
And not playfully. They forced him, yeah.

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41.920
Only two months ago… You fit, man?

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45.040
…Stéphane Blé worked as a monitor at this youth center.

217
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47.200
And then, this happened.

218
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49.920
When you're getting fucked over working, sleeves don't matter.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51.000
Whoa!

220
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53.040
Are you looking for a slogan for your campaign?

221
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55.520
It's '"Liberty, equality, brotherhood."

222
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58.160
Whoa!  He has a knack for punchlines.

223
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00.440
Which he developed during his years in the projects.

224
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02.000
Look at this. Isn't this beautiful?

225
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04.240
The blend of cultures, the energy of hiphop.

226
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07.200
I wanna do some freestyle for you. Do you mind if I do a freestyle?

227
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09.840

236
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29.560
Stéph, what's up? What's up, ladies?

237
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33.520
Stéphane's greatest strength is his roots in his neighborhood.

238
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36.680
He knows the field, the kids, and their discontent.

239
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38.720
They told me you smoke. Be careful!

240
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40.040
Hey, fuck your mom!

241
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41.800
Peace, joy, vote Blé. Amen.

242
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42.880
Peace and joy. Vote Blé.

243
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46.040
Since he's very close to his family and to his roots,

244
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50.040
Stéphane insisted that his mother be part of his close entourage.

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53.520
Ah, you'll vote for him, right? Of course. We're gonna mobilize.

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55.840
I'm just gonna show myself as I really am.

247
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58.720
I'm not gonna lie like politicians. Look. See? Nothing's been hidden.

248
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01.120
It's true that getting to the second match of this campaign

249
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02.880
has been a boost for people around here.

250
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04.800
A boost to brothers, a boost to sisters.

251
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06.320
A boost for me too.

252
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08.200
And hoping for a little bank account boost.

253
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10.560
That's the truth. I'm kidding. I love humor.

254
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12.000
He's not perfect,

255
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15.240
mm, but he has one quality, he puts others first.

256
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16.480
You want coffee?

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19.760
If the people around him are unhappy, then he's just unhappy too.

258
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22.560
I'm out of coffee. Yeah. Do you want a tea?

259
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26.040
It doesn't look like much, but it's important.

260
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29.400
See, this is the real reason I'm here today.

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30.440
Thanks to my city.

262
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31.920
It's given me everything.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34.080
I'll give it everything. That's the plan.

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35.720
THE DEBATE

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41.360
And now, you know a little more about the candidates.

266
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43.000
And it seems to be that, right now,

267
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46.120
the French are seeming to lean towards Mrs. Douanier more than Mr. Blé.

268
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50.240
But nothing's been decided yet. So, Mrs. Douanier, your first question.

269
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52.400
Why should the French decide to vote for you?

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53.680
Good evening.

271
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54.640
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

272
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56.520
Greetings to the manygendered viewers here.

273
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57.960
Hello, Mr. Blé.

274
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00.720
Tonight, France has a chance that's unique

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04.720
as it has decided to put away the entire ancient class of political corruption

276
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08.120
and entrust its responsibilities to an entirely fresh face.

277
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12.320
Well, that fresh face, I can do it, and I wanna do it.

278
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14.600
And tonight, I won't tell you what I'm going to do,

279
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16.960
but I'll say what we are going to do here as a team.

280
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19.880
No man is providential. No woman is providential.

281
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22.720
But I say that there are over 60 million French

282
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25.760
who are providential to their brothers and sisters.

283
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29.120
Thank you.

284
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31.920
Now, Mr. Blé, the same question to you.

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34.320
Why should the French decide to choose you?

286
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36.640
No, it's true. She's good.

287
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39.280
If I weren't competing as a candidate, for real, I'd vote for her.

288
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41.120
You're fair play. That's good.

289
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43.680
Okay, I don't speak 12 languages No, but I only speak seven.

290
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45.320
Oh, can I ask you something?

291
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48.200
My spokeswoman's interpreter hasn't arrived.

292
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50.760
She's lipreading right now. If you could please articulate?

293
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53.960
I am not a college degree hold

294
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55.120
She's deaf, not stupid.

295
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56.840
You're the one who said Just a little.

296
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57.960
There.  Okay.

297
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59.960
I'm a guy you can describe as "normal."

298
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01.760
But not like a president who's "normal."

299
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04.440
I'm normal in the sense that I know the struggle of real folks.

300
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06.920
But if it's in Corrèze or the streets, it's the same struggle.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10.360
Now, I'm not here to mislead you. I'm not promising everything.

302
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12.800
But I am promising to do my best.

303
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17.120
Go Stéphane! Thank you.

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19.800
He's got a fan club. Thank you. Thank you.

305
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22.320
Thank you. Thank you both.

306
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23.960
Now, let's continue on with The Duel.

307
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25.480
Yes.  Duel? This isn't war.

308
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27.480
I'm not at war with Mr. Blé. I respect him.

309
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29.200
And we'll exchange views. Hamdoullah.

310
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30.160
No, it's just for

311
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31.880
Hamdoullah. That's respect. I'm not here

312
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34.720
Well, anyway, here comes The Duel. That's ridiculous.

313
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37.240
THE DUEL

314
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39.520
Mrs. Douanier, some say you're too radical.

315
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42.040
I think, today, we no longer have a choice.

316
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45.240
We need radicals, and downsizing, even demographically.

317
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47.240
Did you know that, in France,

318
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51.240
there are couples who still continue having three children?

319
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53.080
Three children.

320
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55.480
It's absurd! It's irresponsible!

321
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58.080
And Mr. Blé, can you tell me how you'd answer this?

322
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00.480
You know, uh, my wife and I are trying to have a kid,

323
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02.760
and I never stopped to put that question out there,

324
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04.960
of how much waste the child will produce.

325
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05.880
You know? Yeah.

326
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08.040
I just thought about how much love we would share.

327
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10.160
Oh, well, that argument. That's super selfish.

328
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11.880
Me, selfish? I think of the planet.

329
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15.480
Well, but that's my conviction, that our children are going to restore it.

330
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19.080
And they'll save it, thanks to education and an awareness of nature.

331
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21.400
Call me selfish then, but you're a defeatist.

332
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23.440
Your response?

333
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25.600
Yeah. Defeatist?

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27.280
Or am I just responsible?

335
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29.360
Calm down, please. Thank you.

336
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32.720
One hour into the debate, I propose we check the updated voting intentions.

337
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36.560
Based on the figures, it seems that Mr. Blé has just gained a slight lead,

338
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38.800
but, of course, the next segment could shake things up.

339
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41.760
Uh, we are now going to welcome someone who matters,

340
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44.400
or who has affected the lives of our candidates,

341
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45.680
and who will provide…

342
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48.160
well, shine a light on their personalities.

343
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50.480
Next, we have our Guest Surprise.

344
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52.200
SURPRISE GUEST

345
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54.200
Who is it? Who is it, who is it?

346
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55.520
Who's my guest?

347
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57.680
I can't tell you or it wouldn't be a surprise.

348
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00.440
Some people in the hood lie, say we're friends, but I don't know them.

349
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01.640
They're haters and phonies.

350
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04.440
Uh, anyway, let's welcome our first surprise guest

351
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06.000
for Corinne Douanier.

352
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08.480
The guest is Chahiba Daoudzada.

353
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12.040
Oh, my!

354
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15.080
There's a step.

355
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16.480
Pfft.  Chahiba!

356
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18.040
What is this now?  Corinne!

357
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20.720
This is a masquerade. It's been so long! How are you?

358
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22.480
Oh, I'm fine.  Have a seat.

359
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24.640
Welcome, Chahiba.  She's not blind at all.

360
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26.440
Thank you for coming on the show.

361
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27.600
Stéphane. Stéphane.

362
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30.720
A very powerful reunion. We can feel We can feel many emotions.

363
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32.000
Right, Mrs. Douanier? Yes.

364
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32.920
Welcome, Chahiba.

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35.480
Now tell me, uh, who is Chahiba? Well…

366
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36.480
Sorry.

367
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37.960
No problem. Take your time.

368
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39.480
Actually,

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41.640
Chahiba is Afghan.

370
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46.000
We encountered each other years ago through a great program called Shelter.

371
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48.320
Because "shelter," meaning "she,"

372
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49.720
a woman making shelter.

373
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50.960
We understand. Of course.

374
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52.520
Stéphane.  She's Afghan.

375
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54.800
Tortured by the Taliban. She's not blind. She can see.

376
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56.960
…rejected by her family, because she's blind and gay.

377
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58.520
And type 2 diabetic.

378
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00.360
Oh, true.  No. She's not blind!

379
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01.760
She's not blind!

380
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03.600
Sir, please. She's not blind.

381
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06.160
When she sat down, she quickly looked back. She did.

382
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07.840
Now, if I were blind, I'd sit this way.

383
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10.320
She clearly looked. Sir, please listen, sir.

384
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12.960
Sir, please. You also financed her education, right?

385
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14.160
No, yes, it wasn't me.

386
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17.080
Let's just say, the structures… Keep going. I don't think she's blind.

387
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19.080
I just Let's, quick, just verify. No, but

388
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22.600
She didn't put her cane in front. She walked this way, stepped to the side

389
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24.960
Is this a joke?  Mr. Blé, listen.

390
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27.200
You can't stay on set like this. No, no. No worries.

391
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28.960
It's completely disrespectful, sir.

392
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30.520
What's going on?  Mr. Blé.

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32.560
She's blind.  No, she's not.

394
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35.280
Sorry. Sorry. I apologize.  No. Don't apologize.

395
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37.600
She's blind.  You can't behave that way.

396
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40.080
You just humiliated her here, live! She's blind. So sorry.

397
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42.640
We agree. She's a woman, disabled, in exile.

398
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44.880
You humiliated her on live TV! She's not a lesbian!

399
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46.640
I used to worse. Lesbian, bull!

400
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49.240
I saw Taliban's eyes twice in my in my life.

401
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52.320
I'm not scared or afraid of this kind of man.

402
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56.400
Uh, Chahiba, what do you wish to tell the French people

403
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59.200
about Corinne Douanier to guide their decision?

404
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02.240
Oh, French people…  She's crosseyed!

405
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04.640
Yeah. …are very lucky.

406
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08.280
They must realize that Corinne is a wonderful woman.

407
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11.800
Today, I'm, uh, studying at Harvard,

408
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13.760
where I follow a triple degree.

409
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16.760
Sustainable development, human rights,

410
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19.400
and history of LGBTQ persecution

411
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22.080
in the Arabian peninsula in the seventh century.

412
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24.160
Thankfully to Corinne.  There you go.

413
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25.320
This is proof that,

414
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29.520
when a community offers a chance to a person in exile, often,

415
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31.560
the person is an asset for their new country.

416
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34.560
That's not what she said. Yes, that's one point of view.

417
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39.120
May the light guide your steps, Chahiba.

418
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40.200
Thank you. Thank you.

419
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42.680
Everything except France. Afghanistan, the US…

420
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44.600
Sorry. This is all over the place. Pardon?

421
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46.560
Please, sir. Calm down. This is unacceptable.

422
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49.040
I work with Stéphane Blé. William Crozon.

423
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52.400
No, it's not all over the place. We're talking about her journey.

424
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55.280
And yes, it began in Afghanistan, where a woman was abused…

425
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56.680
Oh, yes? …forced into exile.

426
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58.520
Crossed the Mediterranean at her own peril.

427
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01.440
All that and blind? Hmm! She managed to get here, was taken in

428
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03.480
Crossed the Mediterranean blind? William!

429
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05.080
She'd have sunk.  William!

430
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07.480
…that France cannot offer her. Point and match, friend.

431
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09.480
Mr. Blé, calm your team down, please.

432
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11.440
I wanna apologize to Chahiba. No.

433
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12.640
I did have doubts.

434
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15.760
Also, my adviser gave me bad advice.  But I didn't.

435
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18.800
I'd like to hear what you have to say on the issue of inclusion.

436
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20.880
Your plans are what? Respond. That's interesting.

437
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22.240
It's great she's asked me this.

438
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24.440
I've waited for it from the start. Ah.

439
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27.240
You all know that, recently, I was shot, right in my testicle.

440
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28.280
Yeah? Mmhmm.

441
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29.200
The effects of that

442
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32.120
You're saying this to Chahiba, who's been through worse,

443
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35.800
so let's get to your surprise guest, someone who you care about immensely,

444
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38.600
who has a strong character, and who you know by heart.

445
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39.640
Who is it? Granite?

446
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41.040
No, sorry.  It's not.

447
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42.080
Do you mean Grateau?

448
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43.880
It's Claude, your father. That's right!

449
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45.400
Let's meet Claude! Claude is here?

450
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49.400
What are you doing here? Huh?  Ma'am.

451
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51.200
Get out!  Hello, Claude.

452
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53.280
Take a seat right there, please. Oh, my son!

453
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54.920
Ah, finally!

454
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57.520
Claude, uh, you've just arrived from Abidjan,

455
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59.720
and you and Stéphane haven't seen each other

456
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01.800
in about, what, 20 years, is that right?

457
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03.280
Twentyseven years. Absolutely.

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04.400
Eight weeks, four days.

459
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07.200
Life took us apart.  What life took you apart? Huh?

460
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08.440
You took off with Clémentine,

461
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10.680
who was married to Isidore, my very own cousin!

462
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13.680
To satisfy your own needs, you damn idiot! Puh!

463
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16.480
I wasn't getting it at home, so I had to look for it elsewhere.

464
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18.920
You asked for too much. I didn't let you bully me!

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21.640
Well, then, as I was saying, life took us apart.

466
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24.240
I decided to travel the world.  He's a sex addict!

467
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28.120
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. For my trade. Import, export, transport.

468
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30.360
But I always held you in my heart, my son.

469
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33.240
Still, you probably could've called in 27 years. I mean

470
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34.440
Well, you know how it is.

471
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36.440
No. There's bad reception out there.

472
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38.400
For 27 years, bad reception? Really?

473
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40.360
Well, actually, speaking of initiative,

474
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43.000
if you would please dial 00225…

475
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46.400
Oh! Display it here, the number.  No, not possible.

476
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48.240
You could help support a real estate project

477
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50.000
brimming with all types of class!

478
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50.960
No.  Dad.

479
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53.080
Claude! What are we talking about here, sir?

480
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54.600
Don't be interrupting me, girlie.

481
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57.520
Pardon? You're calling me "girlie"?  Hold on.

482
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58.880
What are you doing, Dad? Super.

483
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01.840
The presidency is the arena of men.

484
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05.360
Not for some lady with, uh, perverse sexual preferences.

485
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06.960
Wow! Wow! Wow! The sorry truth.

486
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08.040
I, uh Yes.

487
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10.000
I am distancing myself officially

488
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12.320
from comments made by the individual next to me.

489
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14.160
You know, in Cameroon I'm sorry.

490
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17.520
…that exact kind of fool gets six years of prison time.

491
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20.200
And then a very pricey fine. And that's what kind of person?

492
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22.040
Huh? Huh? Who?

493
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23.760
Yes. Respond.

494
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26.680
Lesbians.

495
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27.760
No, sir. Oh.

496
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29.600
Unacceptable.  Stéphane.

497
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31.480
For your own good, you have to shut him up.

498
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33.520
This cannot continue. Great having you, Claude.

499
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41.040
Oh, Mrs. Douanier, you speak African?

500
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42.000
Please, don't

501
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44.800
But "speaking African" is just No, fine, it's Mina.

502
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47.120
I know a little because I spent six months in Grand Popo.

503
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49.320
Huh?

504
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51.760
Yes.

505
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53.640
No, we're not You know what?

506
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55.720
You are incredibly rude. Get the hell outta here!

507
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56.760
Get out!

508
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58.720
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

509
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01.160
Sir, I must ask you We can't understand you.

510
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02.880
Claude, you need to calm down.

511
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04.800
Stop, sir.

512
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07.440
Someone please take my friend back away from all of this?

513
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10.120
Because when people scream, it reminds her of the Taliban.

514
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12.160
Thank you. It's all right.

515
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16.240
We've been together for nearly two hours.

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18.160
The broadcast is nearing its end… All right.

517
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20.200
…and here are the latest polls. Come on, man.

518
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23.080
Yes, Mr. Blé has 21 percent of the voters,

519
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27.280
against 35 percent for Mrs. Douanier, who's in the lead.

520
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29.000
However, half the French population

521
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31.200
have not yet decided who they will be voting for.

522
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33.560
Yes, in place of a stilted conclusion,

523
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36.400
written by our team of folks in PR who tried their best,

524
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38.480
we're moving on to The Question.

525
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39.760
THE QUESTION

526
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44.640
THE QUESTION

527
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46.120
Mr. Blé, we'll begin with you.

528
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48.480
This is your question, Mr. Blé.

529
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51.640
What is your position on radical Islam Drugtrafficking.

530
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54.040
That works.  Yes.

531
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55.240
According to several sources,

532
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58.640
you are directly connected to traffickers within your district.

533
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01.000
And some are even members of your family.

534
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02.560
IsIs there only one question?

535
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05.520
If you get to the Elysée, who will be safe?

536
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06.920
The French or your family?

537
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09.080
The voters or the traffickers?

538
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10.440
Ooh!

539
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12.760
Suck on that, Blé! Suck on that!

540
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14.880
Suck on that! There, there, there!

541
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17.840
Look at him, look at him.  It's an easy question.

542
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22.000
Mr. Blé? Still got champagne?

543
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24.920
Look at this! We have to celebrate this. Look at him!

544
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26.280
He's shitting himself.

545
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27.880
He's shitting himself!

546
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32.760
Hey, I'll even crack a new case. Hmm?

547
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36.520
PIERRE: THE LOTFI KID IS OUT OF HIS COMA. HE'S ACCUSING LAMINE!

548
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38.480
Oh, fuck!

549
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42.920
We're live and listening, Mr. Blé.

550
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45.920
France is listening.

551
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48.760
Who would you choose?

552
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50.680
The French or your family?

553
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53.480
The voters or the traffickers?

554
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55.480
It's an easy question.

555
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56.960
It's simple. It's yes or no.

556
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58.880
Mr. Blé? We're listening. Yes, okay, okay.

557
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01.880
Yes, all right, there are drugtraffickers in my family…

558
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03.760
Fuck. …in my associates, yes.

559
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04.800
But let me say this.

560
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07.240
When you're Black and there's nothing but poverty,

561
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08.720
your options are limited for you.

562
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11.240
You know you'll be working harder than most folks,

563
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13.680
but you'll be getting less than everyone else in the end.

564
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17.000
To that end, there are those who choose to get by in life that way.

565
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19.640
So, in the projects, we need to stop undervaluing us,

566
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22.120
for more potential, for more vision, for more curiosity.

567
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23.520
We can't let ourselves be limited.

568
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27.880
So I'm asking the people of France to vote on Sunday for Stéphane Blé,

569
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28.920
to prove it's possible,

570
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32.120
coming here from nothing and still rising to the highest office.

571
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34.120
There.

572
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39.800
So, then, uh, you do have a cousin who traffics drugs.

573
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42.040
The French will take note. You missed what I said.

574
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44.840
Uh, we'll be going ahead with Corinne Douanier,

575
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46.400
and asking her The Question.

576
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48.880
Mrs. Douanier, according to our information,

577
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51.840
you sponsored Stéphane Blé, just a few months back, so he could run.

578
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54.400
So if you would explain, two months ago, you supported him,

579
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56.480
and tonight, you're battling in front of the French.

580
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57.840
That seems a bit hypocritical.

581
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00.200
Yes, yes, yes. I sponsored Mr. Blé. Absolutely.

582
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03.920
See, two months or so back, I met, at my HQ, a man,

583
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06.680
a monitor in the area, honest, sincere,

584
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09.960
wanted to change the system, so, yes, I decided to offer him a hand

585
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12.360
for the good of the democratic process, yes.

586
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15.560
However, Mr. Blé, the man I see sitting across from me this evening

587
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18.960
is not the one I thought I knew, to tell the truth.

588
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20.040
During this campaign,

589
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22.480
you acted like everybody else, compromise after compromise.

590
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24.720
You said things then contradicted  Me?!

591
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28.240
Yeah! Example, did you say, "liberty, equality, security"?

592
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29.600
Did you say it or not?

593
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30.680
Yes.  Really?

594
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32.080
There.  I said it.

595
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33.840
There! I was with the police.

596
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37.240
There! You spouted "security" with fuzz. What did I say?

597
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39.160
You turned into a politician. Know what?

598
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42.600
You wanna overthrow the system? You've become the system.

599
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44.400
You've joined with the oppressors! There!

600
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46.640
Wait, are you kidding me? Wait, sorry  No.

601
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48.400
Now I'm one of the oppressors? Yeah, yeah.

602
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51.040
And 400 years of slavery? That doesn't ring a bell?

603
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52.520
Colonization, you know what that is?

604
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54.440
Two thousand years of oppressing women is what?

605
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55.600
Oh, all right! Yeah.

606
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57.680
And there were also African women slaves.

607
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59.600
I'm saying you can't win if you're a woman.

608
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02.080
And that could be changed once I'm elected. There!

609
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06.160
Because you're the archetypal kind of man who's entitled just because he's a man.

610
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09.960
Men like you have been guiding us and leading us to humanity's demise.

611
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12.320
That's enough! It needs to end! Stop!

612
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15.240
For the future, for the planet.

613
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17.440
For our children, for France.

614
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19.160
Long live France.

615
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36.280
Yeah? Did you watch?

616
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37.840
I got the gist.

617
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39.520
We all did. Okay, you watched.

618
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41.000
You saw how bad I messed up?

619
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45.240
No, the beginning wasn't bad, but then they threw everything at you.

620
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46.640
Nasty, with your dad.

621
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49.360
Yeah, it was super nasty. Are you kidding?

622
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51.960
And Lamine, how's he?

623
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55.720
Stéph, you won't be president.

624
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58.400
He needs to surrender.

625
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01.960
We'll find him a good lawyer who can prove that he fell into a trap.

626
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04.200
He won't listen to me, but you can convince him.

627
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05.400
Listen  Please.

628
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06.720
I still have a shot.

629
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09.440
Let me get through round two, then I'll handle everything.

630
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12.520
Stop panicking. It'll be all right.

631
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14.680
I'll call you back, honey. Don't worry. I promise.

632
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16.440
I love you.

633
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22.080
Wow!

634
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27.840
I don't know what to say.

635
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30.440
That was pretty bad.

636
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33.800
I mean, it was really bad. But we can make it.

637
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37.120
There's still pockets of abstention. They're pretty large.

638
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39.120
We'll pick up some votes and make a comeback.

639
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40.400
Don't worry, okay?

640
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42.080
Look at Chirac in '95.

641
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45.000
He was just a total shock. Nobody believed he'd win.

642
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47.240
That said, you need to get serious, for real.

643
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48.400
Listen to me

644
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51.560
Yeah, just a second. We're working. Listen to me here.

645
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53.480
Stick to the basics.  Open the door.

646
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54.720
The social

647
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56.000
Yeah, just a second!

648
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58.600
Social, social. We're together now.

649
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00.320
You listen when I say something, okay?

650
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01.800
I'll listen as well.

651
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04.040
III need to, uh, process  Police!

652
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06.960
It's the police, Mr. Blé. Open up. Police?

653
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10.000
What did you do? I didn't do anything.

654
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13.280
I didn't do anything. You didn't? I don't know what they want.

655
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15.080
Then why are they here?

656
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16.560
I didn't do anything. I don't know.

657
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19.680
Fu… just tell me if you did I didn't do anything, for real!

658
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22.040
I know I didn't do anything. Get the door!

659
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24.160
You're making a mistake, we didn't Mr. Blé?

660
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25.600
He's here. That's him there.

661
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28.720
The boy, Lotfi, who was hurt in your neighborhood last week,

662
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30.160
he's out of the coma.

663
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33.440
He has formally identified Lamine Touré as his assailant.

664
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34.360
No.

665
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36.640
Lamine is part of your campaign team, right?

666
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38.160
Uh, yyyes? No.

667
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40.200
No? No.  No, no. Oh, no. Lamine?

668
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41.960
Not at all. He was a volunteer.

669
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45.720
He just helped hand out some pamphlets. I gave him a restaurant, uh, coupon once.

670
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47.800
Now, is that considered a paid salary?

671
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50.800
I don't think so. He hasn't been part of anything, so, uh…

672
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52.920
Okay, you can clarify all this at the station,

673
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55.880
because Lamine is missing, and you're suspected of helping him flee.

674
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58.600
Follow us, please.  No, please. You can't do this.

675
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01.720
No. There are journalists here. Please. My son is innocent.

676
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03.800
Wait, please, sir.  Where is Lamine?

677
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05.680
We need to know where you've hidden him.

678
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08.960
